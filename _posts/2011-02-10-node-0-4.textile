The second stable branch of Node, 0.4, has been announced.  The "0.4 announcement":http://nodejs.org/v0.4_announcement.html has an overview of the changes, and there's a "GitHub Node wiki page about migrating from 0.2 to 0.4":https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Migrating-from-v0.2-to-v0.3.

A lot of the changes are relatively low-level.  However, libraries and frameworks like "Express may require updating":http://twitter.com/#!/tjholowaychuk/status/34753417272492032.  From what I've learned by watching the 0.3 changes on the "nodejs Google Group":http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs, it sounds like the 0.4 changes are positive -- a cleaner HTTP client API, better HTTPS support, and a more efficient <code>Buffer</code>.

It's also interesting to see npm mentioned in the release announcement:

bq. In particular, NPM was forced to resort to deep symlinks and "shim" modules to work around missing features in <code>require()</code>.

These changes include <code>require()</code> awareness of <code>package.json</code>, and the relative path <code>node_modules/</code> being searched for modules.  This will make it very easy to bundle modules with apps, potentially simplifying deployment and distribution.
