h3. WebGL Examples

!/images/posts/cycleblob.png!

I found this collection of "WebGL examples":http://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/webgl/webgl.htm at "ibiblio.org":http://www.ibiblio.org that includes a few things I haven't seen before, particularly "Cycleblob":http://cycleblob.com/ which is an interesting take on the Tron light cycles concept.

h3. Backbone Forms

"Backbone Forms":https://github.com/powmedia/backbone-forms by Charles Davison is a form framework for "Backbone.js":http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/ with some advanced features like nested forms, and it even comes with CSS for styling fields.

This library makes it possible to automatically generate forms based on model instances:

{% highlight javascript %}
var form = new Backbone.Form({
  model: users.get(userId)
}).render();
{% endhighlight %}

If a model isn't available, a <code>Backbone.Form</code> can be instantiated using <code>data</code> and <code>schema</code> properties:

{% highlight javascript %}
new Backbone.Form({
  data: { id: 123, name: 'Rod Kimble', password: 'cool beans' },
  schema: {
    id:       { type: 'Number' },
    name:     {},
    password: { type: 'Password' }
  }
}).render();
{% endhighlight %}

The source is documented and the README has enough examples to get started.

h3. Third-Party JavaScript

"Third-Party JavaScript":http://thirdpartyjs.com/ by Ben Vinegar and Anton Kovalyov (both from Disqus) is a book about the art of third-party scripting -- writing JavaScript intended to be executed on a remote site.  It's aimed at intermediate developers, and covers distributing and loading applications, server communication, cross-domain iframe messaging, rendering HTML and CSS, authentication, security, and performance.  Considering the authors work at Disqus it seems like a potentially essential book on the subject.

The book will be published by Manning, and an "early access" edition can be purchased from $35.99.  Three chapters are available so far, and the example source code is on GitHub at "benvinegar / thirdpartyjs-code":https://github.com/benvinegar/thirdpartyjs-code.  The first chapter is available for free: "Introduction to Third-Party JavaScript":http://manning.com/vinegar/TPJS_meap_ch01.pdf (PDF).
