"Rutt-Etra-Izer":http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2011/06/rutt-etra-izer/ ("WebGL app":http://airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/ruttetra/) by Felix Turner is an implementation of a "video synthesizer":http://www.audiovisualizers.com/toolshak/vidsynth/ruttetra/ruttetra.htm.  Simply drag and drop an image file to the browser, and it'll render a 3D version using lines.

Different images have varying effects, so it's fun to experiment.  Rutt-Etra-Izer is built with "three.js":https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/.

There are tutorials on the GLOW site, including one which shows how it can work alongside three.js: "Hello Three.js":http://i-am-glow.com/?page_id=75.
