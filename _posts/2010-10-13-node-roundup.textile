Have you been playing <a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>?  One of my Minecraft buddies found "Nodecraft":http://github.com/nornagon/nodecraft by Jeremy Apthorp.  It's not intended for general use yet, but there's some interesting JavaScript in there, like "protocol.js":http://github.com/nornagon/nodecraft/blob/master/src/protocol.js.  You can see stuff like the server packet structure:

{% highlight javascript %}
var serverPacketStructure = {
	0x00: [],
	0x01: [int('playerID'), str('serverName'), str('motd')],
	0x02: [str('serverID')],
	0x03: [str('message')],
	0x04: [long('time')],
	0x05: [int('invType'), items('items')],
	0x06: [int('x'), int('y'), int('z')],
	0x0d: [double('x'), double('y'), double('stance'), double('z'),
	       float('rotation'), float('pitch'), bool('flying')],
{% endhighlight %}

I have a feeling Node would be a pretty good platform for a game server.  I don't know if Apthorp intends to keep working on this, but it's still interesting to look at what he's done so far.

h3. Tempalias

"Tempalias":http://github.com/pilif/tempalias (MIT) by Philip Hofstetter is a Node app for generating temporary email addresses.  It's actually used by "tempalias.com":http://tempalias.com.

bq. The frontend code is pure HTML/CSS/JavasScript using Sammy for the interesting part of the logic. You will find that in public/*. The beef of the code lies in the SMTP proxy (lib/tempalias_smtp.js) and in the model class representing an alias (lib/tempalias.js). Static webpages are served by the web server (lib/tempalias_http.js) using node-paperboy which is - as are all other dependencies - located in deps/ as a git submodule.

It's been around for a while, but it looks like it's still alive.  It's one to file under your 'full node app' bookmarks.
