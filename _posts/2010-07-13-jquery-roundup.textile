Welcome to the jQuery Plugin Roundup, episode 15.  Remember you can send your plugins in for review through our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

h3. Signs of a Poorly Written jQuery Plugin

"Signs of a poorly written jQuery plugin":http://remysharp.com/2010/06/03/signs-of-a-poorly-written-jquery-plugin/comment-page-1/ by Remy Sharp takes a very simple plugin example and then shows some common mistakes -- classics like "double jQuery", where people accidentally call $() on an existing jQuery instance.

If you're interested in writing a jQuery plugin, you should read this and the comments.  The article was posted last month, so there is some interesting discourse in the comments.

h3. placeholder.js

"placeholder.js":http://github.com/NV/placeholder.js (MIT License) by Nikita Vasilyev brings the input element's placeholder attribute to all browsers.  It's a simple plugin, and nicer than using a bunch of JavaScript just to show example field values.

h3. Boxes with Easing and Motion Blur

"Floating Boxes with motion blur and easing":http://www.marcelljusztin.com/blog/javascript/jquery-plugin-floating-boxes-with-motion-blur-and-easing/ by Marcell Jusztin isn't necessarily going to be used in your next project.  The reason I found it interesting is the author uses CSS 3 box-shadow and text-shadow to simulate motion blur, which I thought was a cool hack.

h3. autoNumeric

"autoNumeric":http://decorplanit.com/plugin/ (MIT License) by Robert J Knothe makes supporting international currencies and number formats easy.  This plugin makes input fields automatically display the correct formatting for a given currency -- separator type and placement, currency symbol and placement, decimal places, and rounding are all handled.

I've run into the complexities of supporting multiple currency formats before, so this may be useful in the future.
