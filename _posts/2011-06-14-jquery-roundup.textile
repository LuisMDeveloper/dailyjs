h3. Fathom.js

!/images/posts/fathom.png!

"Fathom.js":http://markdalgleish.com/projects/fathom/ (GitHub: "markdalgleish / fathom":https://github.com/markdalgleish/fathom, License: _MIT_) by Mark Dalgleish is a plugin for building presentations.

Given this HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<div id="presentation">
<div class="slide"> <h1>My Presentation</h1> </div>
<div class="slide"> <h2>My Dot Points</h2> <ul> <li>First dot point</li> <li>Second dot point</li> <li>Third dot point</li> </ul> </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

It just needs <code>$('#presentation').fathom();</code> to display the content as a slide show.  It comes bundled with CSS and supports keyboard shortcuts, so it's easy to get started and use for real presentations.

h3. jQuery-News-Ticker

!/images/posts/jquery-ticker.png!

"jQuery-News-Ticker":http://www.jquerynewsticker.com/ (GitHub: "rhodimus / jQuery-News-Ticker":https://github.com/rhodimus/jQuery-News-Ticker, License: _GPL v2_) by Rhodri George is a news ticker plugin, similar to the one featured on the "BBC News site":http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/.  Before you scoff, this is exactly the kind of thing clients nag me to add to their sites, and this plugin is very well presented.

With some suitable markup, <code>$('#js-news').ticker();</code> will do its magic:

{% highlight html %}
<div id="ticker-wrapper" class="no-js">
  <ul id="js-news" class="js-hidden">
    <li class="news-item"><a href="#">This is the 1st latest news item.</a></li>
    <li class="news-item"><a href="#">This is the 2nd latest news item.</a></li>
    <li class="news-item"><a href="#">This is the 3rd latest news item.</a></li>
    <li class="news-item"><a href="#">This is the 4th latest news item.</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

h3. jVectorMap

!/images/posts/jvectormap.png!

"jVectorMap":http://jvectormap.owl-hollow.net/ is a nice little plugin for rendering maps with various attributes.  The basic useage is just <code>$('#map').vectorMap();</code>, and this will even show zoom controls.

And, there's no need to worry about IE!

bq. It uses SVG in all modern browsers like Firefox 3 or 4, Safari, Chrome, Opera, IE9, while legacy support for older versions of IE from 6 to 8 is provided with VML.
