"MathExt":http://sourceforge.net/projects/mathext/ is a JavaScript library for parsing mathematical formulas by Lars Knickrehm.  It has a very advanced and flexible API, allowing configuration over accuracy, separators, and the radix character.  It supports things like hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, and has translations for English and German.

Loading the required files and performing a calculation looks like this:

{% highlight html %}
<script src="MathExt.Actions.min.js"  type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="MathExt.Class.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="MathExt.Load.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    var oMathExt = MathExt.Load();
    oMathExt.Calculate('cos(8) * π');
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

It's clever enough to get the precedence correct:

{% highlight javascript %}
oMathExt.Calculate('cos 8 * π');
{% endhighlight %}

The scientific-calculator interface shown above can be found in the project's documentation.  It uses "explorercanvas":http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/, which means it works in IE too.
