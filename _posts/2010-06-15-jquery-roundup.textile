Welcome to the jQuery Plugin Roundup, episode 11.  Remember you can send your plugins in for review through our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

h3. Default

"Default":http://github.com/kbjr/Default (MIT and GPL) by James Brumond can be used to manage default text for form fields.  The API can be accessed by calling <code>defaultText</code> on a form element:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('input').defaultText({ defText: 'Enter your first name' }))
{% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, <code>title</code> attributes will be used for the <code>defText</code> option when calling <code>defaultText</code> with no parameters.

h3. YoxView

"YoxView":http://yoxigen.com/yoxview/Default.aspx (MIT license) by Yossi Kolesnicov is yet another lightbox-style image viewer.  It can work with video sites like YouTube, and also image sharing sites like Flickr.  It's also optimised for search engines.  Multiple images can be assigned for a single thumbnail as well, which not all lightbox libraries support.

After installing the script and required assets, usage is pretty simple:

{% highlight javascript %}
$("#images").yoxview([options]);
{% endhighlight %}

The expected HTML is a set of images inside a div.  For more details, see the "API documentation":http://yoxigen.com/yoxview/usage.aspx.

h3. Panel Magic

!/images/posts/panel_magic.png!

"jquery-panel-magic":http://code.google.com/p/jquery-panel-magic/ (MIT License) by Craig Hoover is a curious plugin that turns a page into a set of panels that can be navigated between in a fashion similar to Apple's Expos√© (or Safari's home screen).  The author is experimenting with iPad support, and it seems like a good fit for touchscreens.
