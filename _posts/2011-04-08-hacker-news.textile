"Hacker Monthly":http://hackermonthly.com/ is a printed and digital magazine that collects the best posts from "Hacker News":http://news.ycombinator.com/.  Issue 11 has this on the cover:

{% highlight javascript %}
($=[$=[]][(__=!$+$)[_=-~-~-~$]+({}+$)[_/_]+ ($$=($_=!''+$)[_/_]+$_[+$])])()[__[_/_]+__ [_+~$]+$_[_]+$$](_/_)
{% endhighlight %}

You may have seen this obtuse piece of JavaScript before -- it will display an alert and pop up the browser cookie.  Adam Cecchetti reverse engineers this code and explains exactly how it works.  I'm fascinated by security, so I enjoyed reading this rare and detailed JavaScript security-related post.

If you'd like to read more from Hacker Monthly, we've got 5 digital subscriptions to give away -- worth $29 each!  <strong>Just post a comment with your favourite JavaScript one-liner</strong>, and I'll select 5 winners.  Make sure your comment has a way for us to get in touch (a link to a contact form or Twitter account would suffice).
