TJ from "Vision Media":http://vision-media.ca/ sent us these great libraries:

* "jQuery Event Recording and Playback":http://github.com/visionmedia/jquery-event-playback
* "js-growl":http://github.com/visionmedia/js-growl
* "js-oo":http://github.com/visionmedia/js-oo

There's a "demo":http://visionmedia.github.com/jquery-event-playback/ of EventPlayback.  The API is very simple:

{% highlight javascript %}
$.recordEvents({ duration: 5000 }, function() {
  $.playbackEvents(this, { interval : 25 })
})
{% endhighlight %}

It generates a fair amount of data, so be careful how you use it.

The Growl library, "js-growl":http://github.com/visionmedia/js-growl works with Rhino and basically shells out to <code>growlnotify</code>.  The API is nicer than shelling out yourself:

{% highlight javascript %}
Growl.notify('5 new emails', { title: 'Email Client', image: 'Safari', sticky: true })
{% endhighlight %}

The same author has also written this minimal OO library: "js-oo":http://github.com/visionmedia/js-oo.  It's based on the classes in Prototype, so you get inheritance with the previous <code>init</code> method saved in <code>__super__</code>.
