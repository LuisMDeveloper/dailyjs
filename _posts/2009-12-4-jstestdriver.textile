"JsTestDriver":http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/ is a test runner that you can use to run tests against different browsers.  Browsers are treated like sandboxes, using a capturing API that allows tests to run against multiple browsers.  It works on the command line, so once a browser has been captured it can be minimized and forgotten about. 

It can run tests in parallel as well, so running tests against many browsers on many platforms isn't any more time consuming than a single test run.  The production and test code is stored in each browser and reloads only when source files have changed, so this adds an additional speed boost.

This video by the author explains the basics:

<object width="384" height="313"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/V4wYrR6t5gE&hl=en_US&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/V4wYrR6t5gE&hl=en_US&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="384" height="313" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

Tests look like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
GreeterTest = TestCase("GreeterTest");

GreeterTest.prototype.testGreet = function() {
  var greeter = new myapp.Greeter();
  assertEquals("Hello World!", greeter.greet("World"));
};
{% endhighlight %}

If you'd like to try it out, the "introductory documentation":http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/wiki/GettingStarted should get you up and running pretty quickly.
