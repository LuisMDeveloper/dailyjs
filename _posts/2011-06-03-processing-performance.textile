h3. Processing.js 1.2

!/images/posts/processing-cherry.png!

"Processing.js 1.2 has been released":http://processingjs.org/blog/?p=267.  This version improves WebGL performance, and there's now a guide that shows how Canvas and WebGL relate to Processing's rendering modes: "Understanding Rendering Modes in Processing.js":http://processingjs.org/reference/articles/RenderingModes.

There's a full changelog in the blog post.  And, the image above comes from "Spring and Processing.js":http://www.atelierbinturong.com/2011/04/spring-and-processingjs.html.

h3. Canvas and WebGL Benchmarks

Ilmari Heikkinen posted some interesting "jsPerf Canvas and WebGL benchmarks":http://fhtr.blogspot.com/2011/06/canvas-webgl-microbenchmarks.html to his blog, which includes a "text sources":http://jsperf.com/texture-sources benchmark.

Running the benchmarks will show a comparison against other browsers using "Browserscope":http://www.browserscope.org/.

h3. What is WebGL?

"What is WebGL?":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy3uFupx5CM was a talk by Neil Trevett given at the "WebGL Meetup group":http://www.meetup.com/WebGL-Developers-Meetup.  It's fairly high-level, but Neil does a good job of explaining how the stack of technologies required for WebGL come together to make it all possible.

It also mentions a project by Google called "ANGLE":http://code.google.com/p/angleproject/ which attempts to translate OpenGL ES 2.0 API calls to DirectX 9 for Windows machines that don't have OpenGL 2.0 drivers.  Interesting stuff!
