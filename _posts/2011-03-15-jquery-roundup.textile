* "Improving the Delicious Bookmark Button with jQuery":http://screencasts.org/episodes/delicious-bookmark-jquery
* "Building a Simple AJAX Website with Sinatra & jQuery":http://screencasts.org/episodes/ajax-website-with-sinatra-jquery

It's written from a designer's perspective, which was interesting to me (as a predominantly server-side developer).
