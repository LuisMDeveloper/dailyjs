"JavaGems":http://www.javagems.org/ is a JVM packaging system based on "Gemcutter":http://www.gemcutter.org/.  It's a user-friendly way of distributing and building Java libraries and binaries.  It uses "RubyGems":http://docs.rubygems.org/ and works the same way.

One reason this is useful to JavaScript developers is because the JavaGems authors have added a Rhino package.  This was automatically imported from maven build scripts, which means it won't currently run just by typing <code>js</code>.

However, if you'd like to try it anyway, follow these steps:

# Update or install "RubyGems":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126
# To update RubyGems, type <code>gem update --system</code> 
# Install JavaGems: <code>gem install javagems</code>
# Install Rhino: <code>javagem install js</code>

You can run Rhino with <code>jam</code>:

{% highlight sh %}
echo "gem 'js'" > Gemfile
jam org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main
{% endhighlight %}

"One of the JavaGems authors":http://www.annealer.org said the package will be modified to run out of the box in the near future.

The source for the "JavaGems gem":http://github.com/thumblemonks/javagems is on GitHub.  This includes the following tools:

* <code>javagem</code> - install and manage gems
* <code>jam/jamc</code> - unifies running Java executables
