It's Friday again, which means you're probably not working and preparing for a weekend of drinking and debauchery.  In the spirit of Friday afternoon slacking, here are my latest JavaScript game and graphics bookmarks.

h3. Pac-Man Google Logo

Today Google replaced their logo with a playable JavaScript Pac-Man game (with Flash for sound).

I saved the JavaScript and sprites file for you to inspect:

* "JavaScript":files/google_pac-man/pacman10-hp.2.js
* "Sprites":files/google_pac-man/pacman10-hp-sprite.png

h3. JsMario

"JsMario":http://jsmario.com.ar/ actually plays really nicely.  The code contains useful examples of map management and scrolling code, which could be used for lots of other types of 2D games.

h3. Close with Canvas

"Close with Canvas":http://desandro.com/articles/close-with-canvas/ by David Desandro is an interesting example of generating canvas art using existing images and "imageData":https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTML/Canvas/Pixel_manipulation_with_canvas to get pixel values.

h3. Creating 3D Games with HTML 5

A friend of mine shared this tutorial series with me:

* "Creating pseudo 3D games with HTML 5 canvas and raycasting":http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/creating-pseudo-3d-games-with-html-5-can-1/
* "Creating pseudo 3D games with HTML 5 canvas and raycasting: Part 2":http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/3d-games-with-canvas-and-raycasting-part/

It's over a year old, but it's still interesting because it doesn't use a canvas for 3D -- it uses a raycasting implementation that draws using vertical strips.  It's nothing more than a lot of DOM and CSS manipulation, which is amazing.

These tutorials are by "Jacob Seidelin":http://blog.nihilogic.dk/ who writes a lot about JavaScript and WebGL.
