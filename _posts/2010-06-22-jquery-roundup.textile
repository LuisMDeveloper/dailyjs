Welcome to the jQuery Plugin Roundup, episode 12.  Remember you can send your plugins in for review through our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

h3. Animated Box Shadows

"This shadow animation plugin":http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/shadow-animation/ ("MIT and GPL License":http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/license.html) by Edwin Martin animates shadows using CSS.  It's an interesting effect when used with mouse over events.

{% highlight javascript %}
$('#box1').animate({shadow: '0 0 30px #44f'});
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Colour Animation

"jquery.animate-colors.js":http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/, by the same author with the same licensing, can animated colour properties.  It can animate a lot of different properties, and works more reliably than Color Animations by John Resig:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('#demodiv').animate({backgroundColor: '#400101'})
{% endhighlight %}

Edwin's plugins all work using the standard jQuery <code>animate</code> method, so they're transparent and work the way you're used to.

h3. Twitterize

!/images/posts/twitterize.png!

"Twitterize":http://repsis.com/jquery/twitterize/ (MIT License) by Vicente Plata shows a floating div with Twitter updates from a particular user.

It'll need a bit of styling to make it look really cool, but it's a simple drop-in plugin so it shouldn't be too much work:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('#user').twitterize({target: 'dailyjs'});
{% endhighlight %}
