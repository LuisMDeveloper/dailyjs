h3. JavaScript Garden

!/images/posts/jsgarden.png!

"JavaScript Garden":http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/ (GitHub: "BonsaiDen / JavaScript-Garden":https://github.com/BonsaiDen/JavaScript-Garden) by Ivo Wetzel and Zhang Yi Jiang is a collection of interesting and quirky JavaScript example code.

I spend a good part of every day reading and writing about JavaScript, and I've found things in there that are new to me.  It's definite weekend reading material!

h3. Made by Many's SXSW Node App

!/images/posts/madebymany.jpeg!

Paul Battley blogged about "Made by Many's SXSW Node App":http://madebymany.com/blog/sxsw-takeover-2011, which is an Express app using Mongo and Socket.IO (a combination I've had a lot of success with, too).  The app uses the Instagram API to publish real-time images posted by Paul's colleagues at SXSW.  You can check out the app here: "sxsw.madebymany.com":http://sxsw.madebymany.com/.

It's simple but inventive.  If you're working at an agency and looking to get some Node into your day job, why not try something like this too?

h3. JavaScript Loader Comparison

I've reviewed my share of JavaScript loaders on DailyJS, but I found this "Hacker News JavaScript loader comparison post":http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=2300423 fascinating. 21 libraries are compared in quite some detail "in the linked Google Docs spreadsheet":https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Aqln2akPWiMIdERkY3J2OXdOUVJDTkNSQ2ZsV3hoWVE#gid=0.
