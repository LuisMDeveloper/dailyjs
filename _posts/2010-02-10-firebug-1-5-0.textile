I'm a bit slow of the mark with this one (this post has been sitting in draft for a while), but I just wanted to draw attention to the "release of Firebug 1.5.0":http://blog.getfirebug.com/2010/01/15/firebug-1-5-0/ last month. 

If you don't already use Firebug (or similar tools such as Webkit Inspector) for debugging your JavaScript, I strongly suggest adding them to your armory.  I'm not sure I could survive without breakpoints, step-through debugging, an interactive console, and the ability to inspect and manipulate the DOM. :)

The full release notes for Firebug 1.5.0 are on the "Firebug wiki":http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Firebug_Release_Notes#Firebug_1.5, but highlights include:  

* Mike Radcliffe’s Inspector. A key feature, now solid as a rock,
* Jan ‘Honza’ Odvarko’s expanded and refined Net panel, with accurate timings,
* Steve Roussey’s reworking of HTML editing and entity support,
* Kevin Decker’s CSS and Style side panel improvements,
* Support for dynamic, graphical breakpoints through out Firebug.
* Tested support for the soon-to-be-released Firefox 3.6
