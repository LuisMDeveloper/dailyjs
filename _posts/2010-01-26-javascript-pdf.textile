I searched for JavaScript PDF generation just to see what server-side technologies are available.  I found "jsPDF":http://code.google.com/p/jspdf/, which works both server-side and in browser.  It currently works best in Safari, Firefox 3+ and Opera.

It uses the "data URI scheme":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme to send the data to the browser, which is a problem for IE.

The code is easy to follow -- if you want to learn about PDF generation it's interesting to read through.  There's a "demo page":http://jspdf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/basic.htm with usage examples and the resulting PDFs.

Usage looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var doc = new jsPDF();
doc.text(20, 20, 'Hello world!');
doc.text(20, 30, 'This is client-side Javascript, pumping out a PDF.');
doc.addPage();
doc.text(20, 20, 'Do you like that?');

// Output as Data URI
doc.output('datauri');
{% endhighlight %}

jsPDF doesn't have many options yet -- fonts are hardcoded for example (to helvetica).  It's an interesting demonstration of the power of client-side programming though.
