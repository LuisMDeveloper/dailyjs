h3. OOP: The Good Parts

I just finished reading "OOP The Good Parts: Message Passing, Duck Typing, Object Composition, and not Inheritance":http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/39/ by Nick Fitzgerald.  Obvious references to Douglas Crockford's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742?ie=UTF8&tag=da07e-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596517742">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=da07e-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596517742" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> aside, the article builds on some interesting points by authors like Raganwald that will resonate with many DailyJS readers:

bq. What if code re-use has nothing to do with inheritance, but uses composition, delegation, even old-fashioned helper objects or any technique the programmer deems fit?

Fitzgerald defines a method called <code>quacksLike</code> that he uses to formalize object capability detection and <code>Object.combine</code> for object composition.

These ideas aren't new, but there's an interesting code example of a DOM library that uses these methods.  It'll be particularly interesting to fans of _Let's Make a Framework_.

h3. functools

While we're on this topic, "functools":https://github.com/azer/functools ("documentation":http://functools.kodfabrik.com/man.html) by E. Azer Ko√ßulu is a library for functional programming.  He's tested it with Node, but he says:

bq. Despite functools follows CommonJS specs, my actual aim is to improve the experience of DOM programming

It supports features like iterators, functional composition, currying, and partial function application.

The author is also working on "Roka-Lisp":https://github.com/azer/rokalisp, a lisp dialect written in JavaScript.
