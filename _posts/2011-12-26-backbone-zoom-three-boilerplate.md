### Backbone Fundamentals

[Backbone Fundamentals](http://addyosmani.com/blog/backbone-fundamentals/) (GitHub [addyosmani / backbone-fundamentals](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals)) by Addy Osmani is a new book that introduces Backbone to beginners, helping to piece together the collection of tools and knowledge required to use it effectively.

It's still being worked on, but Addy has already written a huge amount that can be read in the GitHub repository's [Backbone.js Fundamentals README.md](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals/blob/master/README.md) file.

There's also a [Backbone Fundamentals wishlist](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals/issues/3) for those wishing to add their own suggestions for the book, or perhaps even help through contributions.

### Boilerplate for Three.js

[Boilerplate for Three.js](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/12/20/boilerplate-for-three-js/) (GitHub [jeromeetienne / threejsboilerplate](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate)) by Jerome Etienne is a template to get started with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) development.

It renders WebGL if available, else it'll fall back to a 2D Canvas.  It'll also create a scene with camera controls, touch event support, fullscreen, window resize, and screenshots.

###Â zoom.js

[zoom.js](http://lab.hakim.se/zoom-js/) (GitHub: [hakimel / zoom.js](https://github.com/hakimel/zoom.js)) by Hakim El Hattab is a small JavaScript API for zooming into a specific point on a page or a DOM element.  The author states that it's an experimental proof-of-concept, but the effect worked well on the browsers I tested it with.

Some browsers will have a more noticeable visual glitch as anti-aliasing is applied, but the effect uses animation easing so it feels relatively gentle considering what's actually happening behind the scenes.
