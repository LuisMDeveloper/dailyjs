"Akihabara":http://www.kesiev.com/akihabara/ ("source":http://github.com/kesiev/akihabara) is a framework for creating retro games in JavaScript and HTML5.  The heavy lifting is done with the canvas tag, and the author provides several libraries for dealing with common game-related tasks:

* *Gamebox* helps move objects and handle collisions, renders monospaced fonts, and stores data
* *Gamecycle* handles menus and gameover
* *Toys* provides lots of common routines like graphical effects, bullets, bonus screens
* *Help* has JavaScript enhancements and helpers
* *Tool* includes developer tools
* *Trigo* has maths functions
* *Iphopad* helpers support touch-based helpers

If you're not convinced, try playing one of the games.  "Solitude":http://www.kesiev.com/akihabara/demo/game-solitude.html is pretty good!  Make sure you get the keyboard controls right: Z key is the A button.
