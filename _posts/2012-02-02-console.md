The `console` object crops up everywhere.  But what is it, and what can it do?  Most people seem to use it without realising the sheer convenience it can provide.  Let's take a look at where it comes from, and how to use it correctly.

### Built-in vs. Host

The `console` object is what's known as a [host object in ECMAScript](http://es5.github.com/#x4.3.8).  Host objects are supplied by the host environment.  Node's documentation refers to `console` as a "global object".

This is different to a [native object](http://es5.github.com/#x4.3.6) which is an object in the ECMAScript implementation in question, and defined by the specification rather than the host environment.  [Built-in objects](http://es5.github.com/#x4.3.7) are similar, but are present when an ECMAScript program starts.  In addition, built-in objects inherit from `Object` or `Function` whereas host objects might not.

Host objects may also not be available when execution starts.  That's why some browsers treat `console` differently depending on whether the output is visible or not.  Notice that Mozilla's documentation states that this behaviour has changed:

> Prior to Gecko 12.0 (Firefox 12.0 / Thunderbird 12.0) , the console object's methods only work when the Web Console is open. Starting with Gecko 12.0, output is cached until the Web Console is opened, then displayed at that time.

### Methods

Since `console` isn't yet formally covered by a specification, implementations vary.  In Node it's closely tied to standard input output, referred to as "stdio" by the documentation.  This gives rise to `error` and `log` methods that will be printed to the appropriate output stream.

Most implementations give us convenient ways of separating output for debugging messages, errors, and warnings:

{% highlight javascript %}
console.log('This is merely an informational debug message');
console.warn('This is a warning');
console.error('This is an error');
{% endhighlight %}

These messages will be handled differently depending on the environment.  Firefox 10's built-in developer console will display an "X" next to the error, whereas Node will print to stderr.

### Redirection

![Console redirection example](/images/posts/console-redirection.png)

When writing Node scripts, it's a good idea to use `console.error` when displaying errors.  It means that errors can be redirected in the shell -- sometimes I don't want to see standard output, but I do care about errors, so I'll redirect the errors into a log file.

I/O redirection generally works like this: `1>` will redirect to stdout, and `2>` redirects stderror.  Given this example:

{% highlight javascript %}
console.log('This is just noisy debug stuff');
console.error('This means Alex broke something again');
{% endhighlight %}

Then running `node test.js 1> debug.log 2> errors.log` will redirect the debug and error messages to separate files.  Using `1>` will truncate the file to a length of zero, so to _append_ messages `1>>` and `2>>` can be used instead.

###Â Inspection and Concatenation

In most browsers and Node, objects will be automatically printed in a readable format when using `console.log`.  That means printing variables is possible without any extra effort:

{% highlight javascript %}
console.log({ alex: "some dude" });
{% endhighlight %}

In Node, `util.format` is applied to the arguments, which runs `util.inspect`.  Therefore, there's no need to run `console.log(util.inspect(value))` in Node!

Most implementations will automatically concatenate values:

{% highlight javascript %}
var name = 'Alex';
console.log('Name:', name);
// Name: Alex
{% endhighlight %}

Notice how a space is automatically added?  There's no need to manually concatenate a value using `console.log('Message: ' + value)`.  In fact, doing this will mean the value won't be automatically inspected.

Node's `format` method uses `Array.prototype.join` to do this: [lib/util.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/util.js#L29).

### Formatting

Recent implementations also provide nascent string substitution support:

{% highlight javascript %}
console.log('Name: %s, Intergalactic Credits: %d.', 'Alex', -100).
{% endhighlight %}

Support for substitution strings isn't exactly `printf` yet, and with supporting between environments varying somewhat.

### Extras

Both Node and Mozilla provide `console.dir`: Node runs `util.inspect` on the supplied argument and prints the output to stderr.  Conversely, Firefox will display an interactive version of the object, with disclosure triangles if necessary.

Need to quickly benchmark a slow operation?  The `console.time` and `console.timeEnd` methods can also be used in both environments.  The `time` method accepts a parameter which allows the timer to be named:

{% highlight javascript %}
console.time('100-elements');
for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  ;
}
console.timeEnd('100-elements');
{% endhighlight %}

Stack traces can be displayed with `console.trace()`.  Again, in Firefox this will be interactive, and in Node it'll be redirected to stderr.

### Conclusion

The `console` object provides a surprisingly useful amount of functionality.  If you're writing lightweight Node programs, or want to debug something in a relatively modern browser (or browser with suitable developer tools), then try to take advantage of it rather than relying on unnecessary libraries.

In general, when logging with `console`:

* Use the correct logging method so redirection works as expected
* Quickly append variables to messages using `console.log('Message:', value)`
* Use `console` to automatically inspect variables
