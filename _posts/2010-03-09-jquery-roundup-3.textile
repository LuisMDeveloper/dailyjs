Welcome to the jQuery Plugin Roundup, episode 3.  Remember you can send your plugins in for review through our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

h3. gameQuery

!/images/posts/gamequery.png!

"gameQuery":http://gamequery.onaluf.org/ is a jQuery plugin that helps make game development easier in JavaScript.  It's so advanced that the news section on its site has a post from 25th December 2010: so cutting edge that it's from the future!

This plugin offers support for animations and sound handling.  There are various sprite-based methods for manipulating graphics.  Sprites can be CSS sprites, and gameQuery's API can be called to automatically animate them based on horizontal or vertical frame positions.  A sprite might look like this:

It can also do collision detection:

{% highlight javascript %}
# This method returns the list of elements colliding with the selected one, according to a filter:
$("#spaceship").collision(".missiles").each(function() {
  kill_spaceship();
  explode_missile(this);
});
{% endhighlight %}

h3. js-hotkeys

"js-hotkeys":http://code.google.com/p/js-hotkeys/ helps manage handlers for keyboard events.  The API is very simple and clean:

{% highlight javascript %}
$(document).bind('keydown', 'ctrl+c', fn);
$(document).unbind('keydown', 'ctrl+c', fn);
{% endhighlight %}

h3. qTip

"qTip":http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/ is a tooltip plugin that can generate very clear and configurable tooltips.  The site has lots of "demos":http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/, including a nifty one that uses a third-party service to generate external site previews:

The "documentation":http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/docs/ explains what HTML gets generated by the plugin so you can easily customise the CSS.  The API is very simple too:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('ul:last li.active').qtip({
   content: 'This is an active list element',
   show: 'mouseover',
   hide: 'mouseout'
})
{% endhighlight %}
