h3. jQuery UI 1.8.12

"jQuery UI 1.8.12 is out":http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/04/jquery-ui-1-8-12/.  Upgrading should be fairly simple as the "upgrade guide":http://jqueryui.com/docs/Upgrade_Guide/1.8.12 says there are now backwards incompatible changes.  This version includes bug fixes for Resizable, Autocomplete, Datepicker, Dialog, Progressbar, Slider, and Tabs.

h3. IndexedDB

"IndexedDB":https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDB/tree/gh-pages/jquery by Parashuram provides a simple chained API for the "Indexed Database API":http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/.  This specification is still a working draft, but Firefox 4, Chrome, and potentially IE support it.

Indexed Database API is a client-side database for simple values and hierarchical objects.  It supersedes "Web SQL Database":http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/ which is considered deprecated.  Parashuram's jQuery plugin makes a flatter API, which looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
$.indexeddb('BookShop-1').objectStore('BookList').openCursor().each(write);
{% endhighlight %}

The alternative is nested callbacks for each operation, which makes this seem pretty slick by comparison.  I have a feeling we could even lose <code>openCursor</code>, because it seems implicit to me, but that's up to the author.

h3. Apprise

!/images/posts/apprise.png!

"Apprise":http://thrivingkings.com/apprise/ ("License":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) is an alternative to <code>alert()</code>.  Basic usage is just like <code>alert</code>, but it can also prompt for values or act like <code>confirm()</code>.  It looks a bit like Firefox 4's alert boxes.

It doesn't depend on jQuery UI, which means you don't need to add a full UI library just to get prettier popup boxes.
