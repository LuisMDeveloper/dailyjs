I like to keep Friday informal here on DailyJS, so here is my latest set of loosely game-development-related links.

I keep mentioning HTML5 storage solutions in our "useful game-related junk" posts because sophisticated games are much more palatable when they take advantage of local storage.  "Lawnchair":http://brianleroux.github.com/lawnchair/ is an interesting project -- it's like a very simple ORM library that relies on JSON.

It supports iteration and has several ways of iterating over collections:

{% highlight javascript %}
people.each(function(r){
    console.log(r);
});

// Classic with terse shorthand syntax
people.each('console.log(r)');

// Iterate documents conditionally! 
// The first function is a conditional. The second is a callback to execute on records returned by the first
people.find(
    function(r) {
        return r.name == brian;
    },
    function(r) {
	console.log(r);
    }
);
{% endhighlight %}

h3. 91 Icons

I really like these SVG icons by the Raphael author: "91 Icons":http://raphaeljs.com/icons/.  Click an icon to see the path string used to generate the vector.

h3. Campaign Monitor's New Charts

!/images/posts/campaign_monitor_charts.png!

Campaign Monitor have dropped Flash for charts and switched to a JavaScript solution.  What's cool about this is they've written up a blog post explaining how they did it: "Say goodbye to Flash with our all new charts":http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3161/say-goodbye-to-flash-with-our-new-javascript-charts/.

They've used the "Highcarts":http://www.highcharts.com/ library and added touch support so devices like the iPad will work with events properly.
