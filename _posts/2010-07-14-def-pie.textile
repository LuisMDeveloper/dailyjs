h3. Def.js

If you don't love Prototype objects and inheritance there are many alternative options available.  Mainly because prototype-based programming is so flexible, which is ironic when you think about it.  Anyway, I found "Def.js":http://github.com/tobeytailor/def.js (MIT License) today.  It's written by Tobias Schneider, and aims to ape Ruby's object model.

What I found interesting about this library is it uses a single method to generate objects.  I haven't seen this approach before, but I'm probably just late to the party:

{% highlight javascript %}
def('User') ({
  init: function(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
});

def('Admin') << User ({
  init: function(name){
    __super__();
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

I like the use of <code>def('Admin') << User</code>.

h3. CSS3 Pie

!/images/posts/pie.png!

"CSS3 Pie":http://css3pie.com/ (Apache 2.0) by Jason Johnston stands for _Progressive Internet Explorer_.  It brings CSS3 features to IE through IE's "HTML Components":http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531018(VS.85).aspx and JavaScript.  Although "Modernizr":http://www.modernizr.com/ is widely used, Pie is simply focused on bringing the missing CSS3 elements to IE.
