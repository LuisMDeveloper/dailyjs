In "Real-time Collaborative Editing with Web Sockets, Node.js &amp; Redis":http://www.web2media.net/laktek/2010/05/25/real-time-collaborative-editing-with-websockets-node-js-redis/ Lakshan Perera discusses "realie":http://github.com/laktek/realie, a real-time editor built with web sockets, Node, and Redis.  To understand the concept, check out "Etherpad":http://etherpad.com/.

There's a video preview of the project:

Lakshan discusses the reasoning behind using Node in his post, and points out why Node is a good choice for this type of project.  He also mentions "google-diff-match-patch":http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/ -- the diff library he's using, which is available for JavaScript.
