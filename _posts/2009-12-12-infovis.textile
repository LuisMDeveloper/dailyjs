"The JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit":http://thejit.org/ provides a rich set of tools for creating interactive browser-based visualisations.  The project's site includes API documentation and tutorials.

The visualisations are based around a "cross-browser canvas widget":http://thejit.org/docs/files/Canvas-js.html.  Each canvas appears inside a block level element:

{% highlight html %}
<div id="infovis"></div>  
{% endhighlight %}

And is defined like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var canvas = new Canvas('mycanvas', {  
   'injectInto':'infovis',  
    'width': 900,  
    'height':500,  
    'styles': {  
    'fillStyle': '#ccddee',  
    'strokeStyle': '#772277'  
    }  
});  
{% endhighlight %}

The visualisations are driven with a "JSON API":http://thejit.org/docs/files/Loader-js.html#Loader and use CSS for styling.  Check out the "RGraph tutorial":http://thejit.org/tutorials/rgraph/ to see how this comes together.

Although the APIs are extensible an interesting set has been provided, so it's possible to create impressive results quickly.  Data representations include:

* Treemaps
* Radial layouts
* HyperTrees
* SpaceTrees
* Charts, including pie and bar

There are "demos":http://thejit.org/demos/ on the site complete with animations.
