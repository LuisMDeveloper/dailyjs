Welcome to the jQuery Plugin Roundup, episode 7.  Remember you can send your plugins in for review through our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

h3. jquery-text-truncate

"jquery-text-truncate":http://code.google.com/p/jquery-text-truncate/ truncates text based on the rendered width rather than character count.  Usage looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
$("#element").textTruncate();
{% endhighlight %}

The element's parent block is used as the source for the maximum width.  This can be changed by passing a <code>width</code> option.

h3. jQuery Text-to-Speech

"jQuery Text-to-Speech":http://code.google.com/p/jqtts/ by Kevin Hoang Le is a new plugin that converts text to speech using Google Translate's audio rendering API, and a bundled Flash file to play the audio.

It's easy to use:

{% highlight javascript %}
var jtts = $('#jtts');
jtts.jtts({
    elem: '#embedPlayer',
    jPlayer: {           
        customCssIds: true,
        swfPath: '/media/swf/'
    }
});
 
jtts.play(['Welcome to DailyJS']).bind('onComplete', function() {
  // Called after the audio has been played
});
{% endhighlight %}
