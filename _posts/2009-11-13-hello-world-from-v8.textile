Heard of V8 but haven't got a clue how to run it?  Here's a quick guide to get you started.  This guide is intended for Mac OS, but there are "detailed Windows instructions":http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/BuildingOnWindows.

V8 is actually a C++ JavaScript engine, designed to be embedded in another program.  Fortunately Google provide a sample shell that can be built with the bundled build chain.

h3. Step 1: Get Scons

Assuming you've already got Xcode installed, get "Scons":http://www.scons.org/.  V8 uses this as its build tool.  It's easy to install from source, but you could also use MacPorts.  MacPorts will fetch a whole bunch of dependencies -- if you're on Leopard or Snow Leopard you should be OK to just build it yourself.

I installed it like this:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo python setup.py install
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Step 2: Build V8

Fetch V8 from the Google Code subversion repository:

{% highlight sh %}
svn checkout http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ v8
{% endhighlight %}

Then build V8 and the sample shell:

{% highlight sh %}
scons
# Wait for a bit...
scons sample=shell
{% endhighlight %}

You will be able to run the interpreter with <code>./shell</code>.

h3. Step 3: A Less Painful Interpreter

To get command history and more, install <code>rlwrap</code>.  I actually did install this from ports.

Then run: <code>rlwrap ./shell</code>.

h3. Step 4: Hello World

{% highlight js %}
V8 version 1.3.18.6
> print("hello world");
hello world
> 
{% endhighlight %}

I also tried a library I wrote, with insanely fast results:
