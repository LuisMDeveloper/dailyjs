"wtfjs":http://wtfjs.com/ is a blog of JavaScript's irregularities, inconstancies and unintuitive aspects.  The author posts humorous code snippets which are similar to the bad parts from Crockford's "JavaScript: The Good Parts":http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748.

Other than the obvious examples based around the confusing nature of _falsy_ and NaN, there are some interesting examples that might test your knowledge of JavaScript:

{% highlight javascript %}
("foo" + + "bar") === "fooNaN"
(x=[].reverse)() === window // true
{% endhighlight %}

Am I suffering from a kind of blindness due to writing JavaScript for too long, or does the following make sense?

{% highlight javascript %}
"string" instanceof String; // false
(new String("string")) instanceof String; // true
{% endhighlight %}

Of course it's false, it's a string literal rather than an instance of String!  Is it useful to distinguish between string literals and instances of String?
