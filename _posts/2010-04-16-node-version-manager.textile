"Node Version Manager":http://github.com/visionmedia/nvm/ is a tool for switching between releases of "node":http://nodejs.org/.  This is useful for testing your code before deployment, or testing your open source code against different versions of node.  There have been API changes lately so it's worth having a sanity check against major releases. 

Installing a specific version works like this:

{% highlight sh %}
nvm install v0.1.91
{% endhighlight %}

nvm is actually a bash script, much like "kiwi":http://github.com/visionmedia/kiwi (by the same author).  That means it should work on unix-like systems without too much trouble.
