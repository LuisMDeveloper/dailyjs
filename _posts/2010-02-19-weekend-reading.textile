Assuming you're not going to be hungover or... working all weekend, here are some tasty links from my DailyJS link folder.

h3. I Can't Believe It's Thomas Fuchs Again!

"I Can't Believe It's Not Flash":http://www.slideshare.net/madrobby/i-cant-believe-its-not-flash will strike a chord with many people.  It's a presentation by Thomas Fuchs about exciting things like WebGL.  He mentions "SceneJS":http://scenejs.org/ which looks ridiculously fun.

h3. 11 Tips for Creating Great MooTools Plugins

"11 Tips for Creating Great MooTools Plugins":http://ryanflorence.com/11-tips-for-creating-great-mootools-plugins/ by prolific JavaScript blogger Ryan Florence is about writing better MooTools plugins.  He also has some good advice about writing JavaScript in general:

bq. Write methods to do one thing only

bq. Create options for things that the class doesnâ€™t need

bq. Return this with most methods

Never mind about the plugins, I agree!

h3. Balldroppings

Load up "balldroppings":http://balldroppings.com/js/ then keep increasing the _ball drop rate_ until your browser explodes.

h3. Pong

"Browser Pong":http://stewdio.org/pong/.  Have you ever see this version of Pong?  It's hilarious.
