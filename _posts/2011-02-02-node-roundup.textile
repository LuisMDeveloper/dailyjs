h3. Move Code to 0.3: Node 0.4 Coming Soon

In "Move Code to v0.3":http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/49eabb78a934b63b?pli=1 on the nodejs group, Ryan Dahl recently suggested that people move code to Node 0.3 as the next stable branch, 0.4, will be released in the next week.  Exciting times!

h3. Stylus

"Stylus":http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/ is yet another interesting product from LearnBoost and TJ Holowaychuk that aims to revolutionise CSS generation.  It's currently available through npm, and can be installed with <code>npm install stylus</code>.

The language dramatically cuts down the amount of syntax required by CSS, and is really what I thought "LESS":http://lesscss.org/ would be when I first heard about it.

Almost everything is optional, including property colons, and it supports conditionals, mixins, variables, interpolation, imports, iteration, nested selectors, and more.  TJ has already made a screencast demonstrating the language: "Stylus screencast":http://screenr.com/bNY.  It's definitely easy to see the evolution from Jade to Stylus, and I think they'll be a joy to use together.

I also noticed TJ wrote "inspect":https://github.com/visionmedia/inspect recently, which can iterate over objects and display a hierarchy of associated properties.

h3. Ringo 0.7

I know this is the _Node_ roundup, but sometimes I wonder if it would be better to name it the _Server Side_ Roundup.  Anyway, "Ringo 0.7":http://ringojs.org/wiki/Release_0.7/ has been released, with some interesting new changes:

* <code>fs-base</code> has been folded into the <code>fs</code> module
* Script execution will continue until asynchronous ringo/scheduler and ringo/httpclient have finished
* Resources outside a repository root can now be <code>require</code>'d using relative paths

There are a lot more changes in the "0.7 release notes on the Ringo Wiki":http://ringojs.org/wiki/Release_0.7/.
