h3. Buildr, Query-Engine, DocPad

"Benjamin Arthur Lupton":http://balupton.com/ sent us three packages to look at:

* "Buildr":https://github.com/balupton/buildr.npm (License: _MIT_, npm: _buildr_) -- tools for building and merging CoffeeScript, Less, and CSS
* "Query-Engine":https://github.com/balupton/query-engine.npm (License: _MIT_, npm: _query-engine_) -- a NoSQL query engine
* "DocPad":https://github.com/balupton/docpad (License: _MIT_, npm: _docpad_) -- a static site generator

All of the projects have installation and usage guides in the README files.  Buildr supports bundling, compression, and client-side loading.  Query-Engine can manage collections of objects, but also optionally extends <code>Object</code> to work with other objects.  DocPad's templating engine has complete access to the DOM, which means it can be used a bit like a novel CMS.

h3. Search

"Search":https://github.com/visionmedia/search (License: _MIT_, npm: _search_) by TJ Holowaychuk is a simple file searching utility that works a bit like "ack":http://betterthangrep.com/ (my tool of choice, which I use with vim).  It's built with TJ's new library "commander.js":https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js, and has deliciously colourised output:

Is it faster than ack?  On my machine it performs slightly slower than ack, but not noticeably (there's a pause after all the results have been displayed).  Given how simple the source is, it seems like an extremely hackable version of ack.

h3. Node Knockout

"Node Knockout":http://nodeknockout.com/ has had a ridiculous 183 entries this year!  I've been playing around with the entries and some of them seriously give the startups I've seen on "Y Combinator":http://ycombinator.com/ a run for their money.  Check them out, show your support, and get ready for the winners on the 6th.
