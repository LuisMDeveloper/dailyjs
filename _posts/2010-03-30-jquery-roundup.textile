h3. Codename Rainbows

"Codename Rainbows":http://labs.dragoninteractive.com/ is a plugin for generating gradients on blocks of text.  It can apply highlights and shadows as well -- these require CSS styles to get them just right.

The API looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
rainbows.init({
  selector: '.selector',
  highlight: true,
  shadow: true,
  from: '#555555',
  to: '#000000'
});
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure the hex codes are the full six characters because it won't convert abbreviations.

There's an article about the "design and goals of the library":http://labs.dragoninteractive.com/rainbows_article.php, as well as a "demo":http://labs.dragoninteractive.com/rainbows_demo.php.

h3. jsPlumb

"jsPlumb":http://code.google.com/p/jsplumb/ can visually connect elements together with curved (or straight) lines.  The "demo":http://morrisonpitt.com/jsPlumb/html/demo.html has examples of Bezier curves and straight lines.

The API is easy to use:

{% highlight javascript %}
$("#window1").plumb({
	target: 'window2', 
	paintStyle: {lineWidth: 15, strokeStyle: 'rgb(243, 230, 18)'}, 
	endpointStyle: {fillStyle: 'rgb(243, 229, 0)'}
});
{% endhighlight %}

The browser support is very impressive -- the author even lists IE6.

h3. Nivo Slider

!/images/posts/nivo.png!

"Nivo Slider":http://nivo.dev7studios.com/ is a library for image transitions.  It has lots of different transitions, and you can apply them programatically:

{% highlight javascript %}
$(window).load(function() {
	$('#slider').nivoSlider({
		effect: 'random',
		slices: 15,
		animSpeed: 500,
		pauseTime: 3000,
		directionNav: true, //Next & Prev
		directionNavHide: true, //Only show on hover
		controlNav: true, //1, 2, 3...
		pauseOnHover: true, //Stop animation while hovering
		beforeChange: function(){},
		afterChange: function(){}
	});
});
{% endhighlight %}

Nivo can be found on GitHub: "Nivo-Slider":http://github.com/gilbitron/Nivo-Slider.
