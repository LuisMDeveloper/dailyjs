Welcome to the jQuery roundup. You can send your plugins and articles in for review through our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

h3. Touchable

"Touchable":https://github.com/dotmaster/Touchable-jQuery-Plugin ("Simplified BSD License":https://github.com/dotmaster/Touchable-jQuery-Plugin/blob/master/LICENSE) by Gregor Schwab is a small plugin that unifies touch and mouse events across platforms.  Elements must be initialized with <code>Touchable</code> or <code>Hoverable</code> first, then the unified events can be used:

{% highlight javascript %}
var element = $('selector').Touchable();
element.bind('touchmove', function(e, touch) {
  // Do something
});
{% endhighlight %}

There's a "demo":http://dotmaster.github.com/Touchable-jQuery-Plugin/demo/demo.html that shows the basic features and _long taps_.

h3. BetterGrow

This is one of those things that I've had to write myself: "BetterGrow":http://tpgblog.com/2011/01/02/bettergrow/ ("GitHub: theproductguy / BetterGrow":https://github.com/theproductguy/BetterGrow, "demo":http://theproductguy.com/bettergrow/bettergrow.demo.html) by Jeremy Horn will resize textareas as users type.  It's a very simple plugin:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('selector').BetterGrow();
{% endhighlight %}

BetterGrow supports options for <code>initial_height</code>, <code>on_enter</code> (callback), and <code>do_not_enter</code> (explained in the "BetterGrow blog post":http://tpgblog.com/2011/01/02/bettergrow/).  

h3. Rotate and Fly

In "Rotate and Fly off elements with jQuery and CSS3":http://sarfraznawaz.wordpress.com/2010/12/27/rotate-and-fly-off-elements-with-jquery-and-css3/ by Sarfraz Ahmed, the author discusses how to use CSS3 animations with jQuery.  I expected to be able to do something like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('selector').animate({ WebkitTransform: 'rotate(360deg)' }, 1000);
{% endhighlight %}

But this isn't currently possible.  Sarfraz's technique uses <code>setInterval</code> and <code>$().css()</code> to set each proprietary CSS property (MozTransform, WebkitTransform, and transform).
