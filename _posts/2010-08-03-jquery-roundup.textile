Welcome to the jQuery Plugin Roundup, episode 18.  Remember you can send your plugins in for review through our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

I've been writing a lot of jQuery lately, and subsequently I've found some very badly written plugins.  But instead of boring you with those, readers have sent interesting ones in!

h3. js-fragment

"js-fragment":http://github.com/rsms/js-fragment by Rasmus Andersson (MIT license) is a browser-based templating toolkit.  It builds interfaces from _fragments_, which are lightweight templates.

Fragments can be combined and mixed with data, and remote fragments can be loaded from a server.  It can work with a custom version of Mustache as well.  The "js-fragment site":http://hunch.se/js-fragment/ has more details.

h3. jQuery.tubeplayer

!/images/posts/jquery-youtube.png!

"jQuery.tubeplayer":http://www.tikku.com/jquery-youtube-tubeplayer-plugin by Nirvana Tikku is a friendly JavaScript API for the YouTube player.  Given a suitable container, a video can be controlled like this (example taken from the site):

{% highlight javascript %}
jQuery("#youtube-player-container").tubeplayer({
	width: 600, // the width of the player
	height: 450, // the height of the player
	allowFullScreen: "true", // true by default, allow user to go full screen
	initialVideo: "DkoeNLuMbcI", // the video that is loaded into the player
	playerID: "youtube-player", // the ID of the embedded youtube player
	preferredQuality: "default",// preferred quality: default, small, medium, large, hd720
	onPlay: function(id){}, // after the play method is called
	onPause: function(){}, // after the pause method is called
	onStop: function(){}, // after the player is stopped
	onSeek: function(time){}, // after the video has been seeked to a defined point
	onMute: function(){}, // after the player is muted
	onUnMute: function(){} // after the player is unmuted
});
{% endhighlight %}

It's not exactly earth-shattering, but it's the exact kind of thing clients ask me to do.

h3. InputNotes

"InputNotes":http://fredibach.ch/jquery-plugins/inputnotes.php by Fredi Bach lets you display errors under textareas or inputs, based on regular expressions.  As the name suggests, additional information can be displayed as well.

{% highlight javascript %}
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#message').inputNotes({
      sexwarning: {
        pattern: /(^|\s)sex(\s|$)/ig,
        type: 'warning',
        text: "No sex please, we're British" 
      },
      numbersnote: {
        pattern: /[0-9]/,
        type: 'note',
        text: 'Do not type numbers!' 
      }
    }
  );
});
{% endhighlight %}
