"JavaScript, JavaScript":http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/ is a blog by Angus Croll in which he discusses high-level JavaScript concepts and techniques.  Recent articles include tutorials on "closures":http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/getting-closure/, "throw":http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/meet-your-new-best-friend-throw/, and "curry":http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/curry-cooking-up-tastier-functions/.

It's a blog that's worth following if you're interested in improving your JavaScript fundamentals.

h3. var undefined = true

This post on reddit is amusing: "var undefined = true; /* the best way to screw up whole javascript apps */":http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/bia1m/var_undefined_true_the_best_way_to_screw_up_whole/.

It's not really as bad as it sounds because most of us do this:

{% highlight javascript %}
if (typeof made_up_variable === 'undefined') { alert("it's cool, I'm cool.") }
{% endhighlight %}

The other way would be to write the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
var magic_var;
if (magic_var == undefined) { alert('undefined!'); }

undefined = true;
magic_var = true;
if (magic_var == undefined) { alert('undefined!'); }
{% endhighlight %}

This has the worrying outcome of displaying undefined for both cases.
