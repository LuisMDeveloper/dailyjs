Welcome, fellow server-side JavaScript aficionados, to the first Node Roundup.  I get so many interesting Node links that I thought it might be best to do something similar to the jQuery roundup.  These posts will include recent interesting projects built with Node, as well as other Node news.

h3. Experimenting with Node.js

In "Experimenting with Node.js":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/experimenting-with-node-js/, Jeff Kreeftmeije discusses using "node-websocket-server":http://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-server to build an interesting example of real time data where mouse pointer positions are recorded and replayed to other visitors on the page.

The actual blog post features the demo, so you might see other people moving their mouse around as you read.

h3. Expresso

!/images/posts/expresso.png!

"Expresso":http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso is an asynchronous test framework.  It can generate coverage reports, and features very clear reporting.

It can be installed with npm if you want to quickly try it out.  The author, TJ Holowaychuk, also builds the Express framework, so it naturally works well as a HTTP app testing tool.

h3. Node Inspector

"Node Inspector":http://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector by Danny Coates is a debugger for Node that uses WebKit's Web Inspector.  I'm used to working with graphical debuggers so I'm looking forward to using this.  I wanted to paste a screenshot of me debugging some awesomely complex script, but I can't get it to work for some reason... If anyone has any luck please post in the comments.
