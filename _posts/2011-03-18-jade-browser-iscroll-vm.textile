h3. Jade Browser

"Jade Browser":https://github.com/weepy/jade-browser by Jonah Fox is an attempt to get "Jade":http://jade-lang.com/ templates to work in browsers.  The same author wrote "brequire":https://github.com/weepy/brequire which helps load CommonJS modules in browsers, so it seems like Jade Browser wraps around the standard Jade library rather than reimplementing it.

h3. iScroll

!/images/posts/iscroll.png!

Hugh Fraser sent us a link to "iScroll":http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4 by Matteo Spinelli, which is a WebKit library for creating iOS native styled tables with correct scrolling behaviour.  It has quite a lot of features, including pinch to zoom gesture support, custom scrollbars, pull to refresh, and a paginated carousel.

It doesn't depend on jQuery, so you could use it with your favourite mobile framework.

Given a few divs and an unordered list, it can be used like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
myScroll = new iScroll('wrapper');
{% endhighlight %}

h3. VM Form Validator

!/images/posts/vmform.jpeg!

"VM Form Validator":http://www.virtuosimedia.com/dev/javascript/mootools-plugins/vm-form-validator/ by Benjamin Kuker is a new form validation library for MooTools 1.3.  All of the "VM Form Validator demos":http://www.virtuosimedia.com/dev/javascript/mootools-plugins/vm-form-validator/vm-form-validator-demos are created with jsFiddle, so it's easy to see how it works.

Basic usage is like many form libraries out there:

{% highlight javascript %}
var form1 = new VMFormValidator('register');
form1.required('username', 'You must enter a username');
form1.minLength('username', 5);
form1.required('email');
form1.email('email');
form1.noMatches('password', 'username');
form1.required('confirmPassword');
form1.matches('confirmPassword', 'password');        
{% endhighlight %}

We don't usually feature many non-jQuery libraries here, but I am interested in them so please share your stuff!
