h3. Distributed Mandelbrot Generation

!/images/posts/dmandel.png!

When I was at university my dissertation was on distributed computing with arbitrary-precision arithmetic.  Which basically meant I used an entire lab to generate pretty pictures with very large numbers.

So when I found "mandlebrotapp.appspot.com":http://mandlebrotapp.appspot.com/jobs I got all misty-eyed and nostalgic.  It uses browsers to generate sections of the Mandelbrot set.  It has a basic job management system so you can submit new jobs, and it'll use different colours during rendering so you can see which blocks other people generated.

Given the news of recent password leaks from major sites, if anyone has the guile to create a rainbow table hash cracker using JavaScript delivered over ad networks the Internet will probably fall apart.  Don't do that!  Unless it's purely for research purposes, of course.

h3. What to Read to Get Up to Speed in JavaScript

"What to Read to Get Up to Speed in JavaScript":http://blog.reybango.com/2010/12/15/what-to-read-to-get-up-to-speed-in-javascript/ by Rey Bango is list of books and blogs for beginner, intermediate, and experienced JavaScript developers.  It mentions the classics, like _JavaScript: The Good Parts_, and even includes DailyJS (thanks!)

h3. 1k Christmas Tree

More animated weather effects.  This is becoming a DailyJS meme now.  "This animated Christmas tree":http://js1k.com/2010-xmas/demo/856 by "@romancortes":http://twitter.com/romancortes uses Canvas to render a rotating 3D tree, complete with falling snow.

h3. Mobile Web Application Best Practices

"Mobile Web Application Best Practices":http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-mwabp-20101214/ is a W3C Recommendation published on 14th December, 2010.  It consists of a list of 32 best practices, with explanations for each point:

bq. Use Cookies Sparingly

bq. Cookies are a common and effective means to store small amounts of state on the client. [...] Information stored in cookies, however, is sent to the server for every request and so using them for excessive amounts of data can negatively impact performance, particularly on a mobile network.

I actually think this would be a great resources for developers new to mobile web development, and even useful as a sanity check for more experienced developers and designers.
