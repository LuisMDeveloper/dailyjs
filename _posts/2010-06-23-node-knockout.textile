"Node Knockout":http://nodeknockout.com/ is based on Rails Rumble -- an event where contestants in teams up to 4 get 48 hours to build a web project from scratch with "Node":http://nodejs.org/.  The event begins on August 28th, and contestants can take part simply by submitting code to GitHub and deploying projects to Joyent or Heroku.

Node Knockout was started by "fortnight labs":http://www.fortnightlabs.com/ who made "Track Your Happiness":http://www.trackyourhappiness.org/, "among other things":http://www.fortnightlabs.com/portfolio.
