We've already been using functions and methods (remember the difference?) as part of this series, but it's time to take a deeper look at one of my favourite parts of the language.  Prepare to have your mind blown by two incredible facts about the humble function.

###Functions are Objects

The [ECMAScript Language Specification](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) defines three ways to create functions.  The first is a function declaration:

{% highlight javascript %}
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
{% endhighlight %}

A `Function` object will be instantiated behind the scenes, and returned as the result of this expression.  With that in mind, the following should make complete sense:

{% highlight javascript %}
var sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
{% endhighlight %}

The function expression results in a value being returned, and it can be assigned as required.  That's because the function's _identifier_ is optional, and also because a `Function` object is returned.

The `Function` constructor isn't hidden away by the interpreter, however.  It can be used like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var sum = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
{% endhighlight %}

That brings us to an important point: _functions are objects_.  They're not a pre-OO construct that's used to somehow build JavaScript's object-oriented features -- they're actually objects themselves and can be manipulated as such.

When functions are passed as arguments or set to variables, they're colloquially known as _anonymous functions_.  This term isn't used within the ECMAScript specification, but you'll see it referred to when people discuss popular APIs like jQuery:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('selector').each(function() {
  // Inside the anonymous function passed to jQuery's `each` method
});
{% endhighlight %}

###Closures

Functions can be created anywhere an expression can appear, which means they can appear inside other functions:

{% highlight javascript %}
function sum(a, b) {
  function max() {
    return a > 100 || b > 100;
  }

  if (max()) {
    throw new ArgumentError('Value too large');
  }
  return a + b;
}
{% endhighlight %}

We've already used this when creating "private" functions inside prototype methods and constructors.  However, notice how the arguments to `sum` are visible inside the `max` function.  Internally, the function is passed the [VariableEnvironment](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-10.3) of the current context, which is otherwise known as the _scope_.

The fact these inner functions receive access to the variables in their containing function's scope is useful, and known as a [closure](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-13):

> Let _closure_ be the result of creating a new Function object as specified in 13.2 with parameters specified by FormalParameterListopt and body specified by FunctionBody. Pass in funcEnv as the Scope.

###Next

Next week we'll look at functions in more depth.
