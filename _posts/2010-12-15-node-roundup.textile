Welcome to the Node Roundup. Send in your apps and libraries using our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

h3. Onvalid

"Onvalid":https://github.com/doffm/Onvalid ("License":https://github.com/doffm/Onvalid/blob/master/LICENSE) by Mark Doffman is a validation library for Node (but should work elsewhere).  The "Onvalid documentation":http://doffm.github.com/Onvalid/onvalid.html is quite detailed and contains a lot of examples.  The suggested usage looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var __ = Onvalid = require('./onvalid');

var schema = {
  name: __.exists
};

var user = {
  'name': 'Bob'
};

if (Onvalid.validate(user, schema)) {
  console.log('OK');
}
{% endhighlight %}

Error messages are supplied to a callback as the third parameter of the <code>validate</code> method.

I like the idea of using decoupled validation libraries, a library like this would work well with our Mongoose-based Nodepad tutorial project.

h3. node-rlog

"node-rlog":https://github.com/jbrisbin/node-rlog (Apache License 2.0) by J. Brisbin is a distributed logging solution for Riak and Node in the form of a library and command-line utility.  The Node usage is very simple:

{% highlight javascript %}
var rlog = require('node-rlog'),
    log = rlog.getLogger('bucketname');
log.debug('This is a debug line: ', myobj, myobj2);
{% endhighlight %}

Logs can then be viewed with the <code>noderlog</code> utility:

{% highlight sh %}
noderlog -b bucketname
{% endhighlight %}

Install it with <code>npm</code> from the GitHub repository:

{% highlight sh %}
git clone https://github.com/jbrisbin/node-rlog.git
npm install ./node-rlog
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Wave-Node

!/images/posts/wavenode.png!

"Wave-Node":https://github.com/scottbw/wave-node (Apache License 2.0) by scottbw is a Node implementation of the "Google Wave Gadget API":http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/overview.html.  It uses WebSockets, which I thought was interesting because I'm fairly sure the last time I used Wave it polled aggressively with XMLHttpRequests.

Apparently it can be integrated with the "Apache Wookie W3C Widget server":http://getwookie.org/.

If you want to try out the server and examples, you'll need to check the code out from GitHub and install redis.
