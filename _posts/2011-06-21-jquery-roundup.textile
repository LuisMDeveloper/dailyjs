h3. jQuery 1.6.2 RC 1

"jQuery 1.6.2 RC 1":http://blog.jquery.com/2011/06/14/jquery-162rc1-released/ was released last week.  This version is a maintenance release, with bug fixes for IE, and a "long-standing animation bug":http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9220 that I ran into recently.

"jquery-lifestream":http://christianv.github.com/jquery-lifestream/ (GitHub: "christianv / jquery-lifestream":https://github.com/christianv/jquery-lifestream, License: _CC Attribution 3.0 Unported_) by Christian Vuerings displays a list of activity for lots of social networks, including Twitter, Last.fm, Pinboard, and GitHub.  The author has even made a little tool that can be used to "create a lifestream":http://christianv.github.com/jquery-lifestream/me/. 

Usage is straightforward:

{% highlight javascript %}
$("#lifestream").lifestream({
  "list":[
    {
      "service": "github",
      "user": "christianv"
    },
    {
      "service": "twitter",
      "user": "denbuzze"
    }
  ]
});
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Better-Autocomplete

"Better-Autocomplete":https://github.com/betamos/Better-Autocomplete (License _MIT and GPL_) by Didrik Nordstr√∂m is an autocompletion plugin that supports searching arrays, objects, and remote JSON data out of the box:

{% highlight javascript %}
var colors = [
	{
	  title: 'Red',
	  description: 'The color of the heart.'
	},

  'Yellow', // You can even mix real result objects with plain strings
  {
    title: 'Green',
    description: 'If you look at your plants, they will likely be green.'
  }
];

$('#color').betterAutocomplete('init', colors, { charLimit: 1 }, {
  select: function(result) {
    $('#color').blur();
    alert('You selected ' + result.title);
  }
});

$('#geonames').betterAutocomplete('init', 'http://ws.geonames.org/searchJSON' // ...
{% endhighlight %}

It makes creating "rich" result sets quite easy -- "try the colours example":file://localhost/tmp/Better-Autocomplete/example.html to see what I mean.  This plugin also has "documentation":http://betamos.se/better-autocomplete/symbols/jQuery.betterAutocomplete.html.

Although Better-Autocomplete only targets modern browsers and the author admits IE support isn't a priority, it seems lean and well made.
