h3. jQuery 1.5.1 RC 1 Released

"jQuery 1.5.1 RC 1 is out":http://blog.jquery.com/2011/02/18/jquery-1-5-1-rc-1-released/, with over 30 bug fixes and improvements.

One fix that caught my eye was "#8245: Ajax now ensures header names are capitalized so that non-compliant xhr implementations donâ€™t override them":http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8245 -- when writing the DailyJS _framework_ tutorials I noticed that jQuery had these headers in lowercase, but other implementations capitalised them.

h3. betterflow.js

"betterflow.js":https://github.com/ruidlopes/betterflow.js (MIT License) by Rui Lopes is a coverflow-inspired plugin.  The "betterflow.js demo":http://ruidlopes.github.com/betterflow.js/ works pretty well with the mouse and keyboard shortcuts.  It even works with horizontal mousewheel movements, which surprised me because this is what I instinctively tried to do when I loaded the page.

It expects some simple markup (Rui's example uses an unordered list with divs and images), and then just a call to <code>$("#example").betterflow();</code>.

h3. domsearch.js

"domsearch.js":http://juliocesar.github.com/jquery-domsearch/ (GitHub: "juliocesar / jquery-domsearch":https://github.com/juliocesar/jquery-domsearch, MIT License) by Julio Cesar Ody makes searching elements like tables very simple.

I've written things like this before, but with pretty basic search/sort algorithms.  This plugin uses "LiquidMetal":https://github.com/rmm5t/liquidmetal/:

bq. Applications like Quicksilver, LaunchBar, and Launchy have made this method of keyboard entry a popular one. It's time to bring this same functionality to web controls. LiquidMetal makes scoring long strings against abbreviations easy.

Given a set of elements, domsearch can be invoked like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('#search').domsearch('table#fruits', {criteria: ['td.price', 'td.weight']});
{% endhighlight %}

This searches on two columns in the table.

There's a lot of places where I could use this plugin, and it looks like the LiquidMetal author (Ryan McGeary) put some effort into performance.
