"Ed Spencer's":http://edspencer.net/ "Jaml":http://github.com/edspencer/jaml is a new project, inspired by Ruby's "Haml":http://haml-lang.com/, for generating nicely formatted HTML in your JavaScript projects without resorting to messy string manipulation.

In the simplest case, you just register a function, using a neat "DSL":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Specific_Language to create your various HTML elements, and then ask Jaml to render it.

{% highlight js %}
Jaml.register('myList', function() {
    ul(
      li("First Item"),
      li("Second Item"),
      li("Third Item")
    );
});
Jaml.render('myList');
{% endhighlight %}

Jaml also supports templating: you can pass a hash to the <code>render</code> function with data to be injected into your HTML template.  And templates can be reused inside other templates to keep your code "DRY":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself.  

See the  "README on Github":http://github.com/edspencer/jaml/blob/master/README.textile for more examples.  "This article":http://edspencer.net/2009/11/jaml-beautiful-html-generation-for-javascript.html on Ed's blog is also worth checking out for some background.
