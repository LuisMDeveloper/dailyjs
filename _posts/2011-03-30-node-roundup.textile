h3. Browserify

!/images/posts/browserify.png!

"Browserify":http://substack.net/posts/24ab8c (GitHub: "substack / node-browserify":https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) by James Halliday makes CommonJS packages work in browsers by bundling up modules into a monolithic file.  I know we've had a lot of script loaders on DailyJS, and detailed discussions about monolithic files vs. loading scripts on demand, but I assume James has structured Browserify this way to make the <code>require</code> syntax easy to support.

The package includes Connect middleware:

{% highlight javascript %}
var connect = require('connect');
var server = connect.createServer();
server.use(connect.static(__dirname));
server.use(require('browserify')(__dirname + '/js'));

server.listen(9797);
{% endhighlight %}

The dependency support is interesting as well:

bq. If the npm modules have dependencies, those dependencies will get bundled along recursively!

It's also possible to run modules through minifiers, using post-filters.

I think this must be the most convenient way to share code between Node and browsers that I've seen so far.

I also seem to remember writing about "Nodules":http://github.com/kriszyp/nodules which is similar to this project, and "brequire":https://github.com/weepy/brequire.

h3. NowJS

"NowJS":http://nowjs.com/ (GitHub: "Flotype / now":http://github.com/flotype/now) aims to make real-time applications easier to develop by synchronising functions and variables in a namespace between clients and a server.

It can be set up with an Express app like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var app = express.createServer();
app.listen(3000);
var everyone = require("now").initialize(app);
{% endhighlight %}

The authors have already written a "NowJS Coding Patterns and Best Practices":http://nowjs.com/bestpractices guide, which explains how to filter messages at the client-side (for creating rooms in a chat application), and tips for keeping things efficient.

h3. Vogue

"Vogue":http://aboutcode.net/vogue/ (GitHub: "andrewdavey / vogue":https://github.com/andrewdavey/vogue, "License":https://github.com/andrewdavey/vogue/blob/master/license.txt) by Andrew Davey automatically reloads stylesheets whenever they're saved.  It uses "Socket.IO":http://socket.io/ so it feels pretty responsive.  It's a great idea for use during development, and I imagine it would blow your design team's collective minds.
