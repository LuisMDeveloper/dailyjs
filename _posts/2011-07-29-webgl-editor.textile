h3. Upscaling WebGL

In "Dirty Full-Frame WebGL Performance Hack":http://blog.tojicode.com/2011/07/dirty-full-frame-webgl-performance-hack.html by Toji, the author discusses a technique for upscaling a lower resolution WebGL canvas.  Basically, CSS3 is used to scale the content.  The post has some interesting comments discussing this approach compared to changing the viewport size.

h3. Open Source Programmer's Text Editor using Canvas and WebGL

"Open Source Programmer's Text Editor using Canvas and WebGL":http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1241383920/open-source-programmers-text-editor-using-canvas-a is a Kickstarter project started by Robey Holderith to create a browser-based open source text editor.  Robey argues that using native browser features like tabs, and JavaScript for the macro language, would make a great portable text editor.

He cites netbooks as a target platform and mentions that this project is intended to be a programmer's text editor rather than an IDE.

Backers have currently offered $1,488 of the $4,096 target.  I intend to support this project purely because the pledge prices and target are powers of two.

h3. minimal

"minimal":https://github.com/timmywil/minimal by timmywil is a client-side library that focuses on performance and saving bytes rather than ease of use.  It supports older browsers, so it actually includes a limited-but-fast selector engine.

Like jQuery, it has a core library with the all important <code>minimal.each</code> function, but it also has other must-have features like:

* Class, attributes, and CSS manipulation;
* DOM traversal;
* And events.

If you like the _Framework_ series that I run on DailyJS it's worth checking out minimal, I've enjoyed rifling through the source.
