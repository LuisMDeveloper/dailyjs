h3. jQuery UI Updates

This month saw the release of "jQuery UI 1.8.6":http://blog.jqueryui.com/2010/11/jquery-ui-1-8-6/ which adds support for jQuery 1.4.3 and IE 9, as well as a whole bunch of bug fixes.

"jQuery UI 1.9 Milestone 3":http://blog.jqueryui.com/2010/11/jquery-ui-1-9-milestone-3-spinner/ was also released, which adds a new Spinner widget:

bq. A spinner is a simple widget that allows users to increment or decrement the current text box value without having to input it manually. Increments do not have to be whole numbers â€” they can be set to decimal values (0.1) or large increments (5) for each click.

The "Accordion API":http://blog.jqueryui.com/2010/11/accordion-api-redesign/ has also been redesigned.  It removes some options in favour of alternatives, and it makes the API a little bit cleaner and more consistent.

h3. Slides

<img src="/images/posts/slides.png" alt="Slides Logo" style="border: none" />

"Slides":http://www.slidesjs.com/ (GitHub: "nathansearles / Slides":https://github.com/nathansearles/slides/, Apache license) is another slideshow plugin for jQuery.  Like most modern sliding image plugins, this one uses simple markup to represent the gallery, then uses a simple call, <code>$('#element').slides()</code> to set everything up.

Slides has some useful features like image preloading and pagination, and a boatload of customisation options for controlling things like transition effects.

h3. Snowfall Plugin

It's snowing in the UK and I noticed this animated "Snowfall Plugin":http://www.somethinghitme.com/2010/04/29/jquery-snowfall-plugin-1-3/ by Jason Brown, so I thought I'd include it to be festive.  The snowflakes are actually divs, imagine that!
