In "When is a global variable not a variable?":http://andrew.hedges.name/blog/2010/04/07/when-is-a-global-variable-not-a-variable, Andrew Hedges discusses the difference between variables and global properties.

Try running this example:

{% highlight javascript %}
try {
   // The alert will display undefined
   alert(a);
}
catch (e) {
   // Not executed
   alert(e);
}

var a = 10;

try {
   alert(b);
}
catch (e) {
    // The alert will display a reference error
   alert(e);
}

b = 10;
{% endhighlight %}

Removing <code>var</code> actually creates a global property.  The distinction is slight, but worth being aware of:

bq. The biggest difference between the two is that variables can't be deleted using the delete statement. Properties can.

Most people can work safely without ever being aware of this underlying behaviour, but it's an interesting point.
