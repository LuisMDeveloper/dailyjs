h3. bigint

"bigint":https://github.com/substack/node-bigint by James Halliday is an arbitrary precision arithmetic library for Node.  Large integers can be defined with strings, then manipulated with the library's methods:

{% highlight javascript %}
var bigint = require('bigint');

var b = bigint('782910138827292261791972728324982')
    .sub('182373273283402171237474774728373')
    .div(8);
{% endhighlight %}


Note that there's also a <code>destroy</code> method:

bq. Destroy a bigint. This module is using node-ffi so I can't hook onto the GC easily. You only need to call this if you're creating bigints in a loop.

Other methods include <code>rand</code>, <code>pow</code>, and more.  This library can be installed with <code>npm install bigint</code>.

I actually have some experience in working with arbitrary precision arithmetic from back in my university days -- I wrote a distributed fractal generator with various numerical libraries.  In Ada...  This sounds like a lot more fun!

h3. Mingy

I like writing CLI stuff, so I thought "Mingy":https://github.com/mcantelon/node-mingy by Mike Cantelon sounded pretty cool.  He describes it as a "cheap and cheerful command parser/server for node.js", perfect for creating command-line tools, text adventure games, and even MUDs.

It can run as a server (hence the MUD reference), copes with multiple users, includes validation support, and even has Expresso tests.

h3. kyoto-client

"kyoto-client":http://kyoto-client.org/ (GitHub: "wezm / kyoto-client":https://github.com/wezm/kyoto-client, BSD License) by Wesley Moore is a "Kyoto Tycoon":http://fallabs.com/kyototycoon/ client library.  Kyoto Tycoon is a lightweight database server, from FAL Labs, who also created the older Tokyo Cabinet key value database.

The kyoto-client module has some good documentation on the site and seems straightforward to use.  It can be installed with <code>npm install kyoto-client</code>.

h3. Blagovest's NPM Search

"Blagovest's NPM Search":http://blago.dachev.com/modules by Blagovest Dachev is a convenient (and fast) way to browse npm.  In fact, it's exactly the kind of thing I need to find things to write about for DailyJS.  Thanks Blagovest!
