"FireRainbow":http://firerainbow.binaryage.com/ is an add-on for Firefox and Firebug that adds themable syntax highlighting.  It uses the JavaScript library "CodeMirror":http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/ to perform the highlighting, and has CSS themes.  You can get the themes off "firerainbow/themes":http://github.com/darwin/firerainbow/tree/master/themes on GitHub and paste them into the _Colors_ tab within Firebug.

The performance is good, and it makes Firebug that little bit more usable and customised.

Another useful Firebug plugin is "Eventbug":http://getfirebug.com/releases/eventbug/1.5/.  I also wrote a "post about Eventbug":/2009/11/04/eventbug/.
