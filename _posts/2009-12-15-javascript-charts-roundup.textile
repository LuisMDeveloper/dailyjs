Following up from "last week's post about gRaphaÃ«l":http://dailyjs.com/2009/12/09/raphael-javascript-charts/, I thought I'd try to summarize some of the other charting options available to JavaScript developers.

h3. "Flot":http://code.google.com/p/flot/

Flot is a jQuery-based JavaScript plotting library, which focuses on simple usage. The results are fairly attractive, and has some interactive features, such as zooming.  It works with all modern browsers (including IE6+, where Google's "ExCanvas":http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ is used). If you're into Prototype, check out "Flotr":http://solutoire.com/flotr/, a Prototype port.

h3. "jqPlot":http://www.jqplot.com/

This is another jQuery plugin, and produces results not dissimilar to Flot.  It provides quite a wide range of graphing options.

h3. "dojo Charts":http://www.dojotoolkit.org/projects/dojox

Dojo Charting, part of the "Dojo Toolkit":http://dojotoolkit.org/projects/dojox, provides many common chart types including line, bar, area and pie charts.

h3. "Bluff":http://bluff.jcoglan.com/

Bluff is a James Coglan's JavaScript port of Ruby's "Gruff":http://nubyonrails.com/pages/gruff graphing library.  It depends on James' "JS.Class":http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/ (and ExCanvas to support IE).

h3. "PlotKit":http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/

PlotKit is based on "MochiKit":http://www.mochikit.com/, but unfortunately only supports IE6+ via Adobe's discontinued "SVG viewer":http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/mainframed.html.

h3. "Protochart":http://www.deensoft.com/lab/protochart/

Inspired by Flot and PlotKit, Protochart build upon Prototype and ExCanvas, providing a good range of charting options.

h3. "Google Visualisations":http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/

Google Visualizations provide a variety of ways to represent your data, including charts from the "Google Chart API":http://code.google.com/apis/chart as well as pure client-side visualizations (some of which require Flash).

h3. "Yahoo UI Charts":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/

YUI charts let you visualize tabular data on a web page in a variety of different ways, but unfortunately the chart control depends on Flash 9.
