I like "Node":http://nodejs.org a lot, so I was looking around "Ryan Dahl's":http://github.com/ry repositories and noticed "node_debug":http://github.com/Connorhd/node_debug.  Node Debug is a browser-based console and object explorer that gives you a <abbr title="read-eval-print loop">REPL</abbr> for a node app.

To use it, download the repository and add the following code to one of your projects:

{% highlight javascript %}
var debug = require("debug.js");
debug.listen(8080);
{% endhighlight %}

Then run it with <code>node</code>.

If you can't be bothered, it looks like this:

Pretty useful!

If you're working on any Node-based projects, let me know in the comments and I'll pick the ones I have time to review for an upcoming post.
