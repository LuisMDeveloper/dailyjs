"Raphaël":http://raphaeljs.com/ is a great little JavaScript library that helps to simplify working with vector graphics on the web.  It uses "SVG":http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ where possible (or "VML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language for IE6+).

"gRaphaël":http://g.raphaeljs.com/ is a graphing library based on Raphaël, providing a way to draw pie, bar, line and dot charts, including support for interactive features such as dynamic labels and highlighting.

To draw a chart with gRaphaël you need to include on your page raphael.js, g.raphael.js and the script for the particular chart(s) you need (e.g. g.pie.js).

{% highlight html %}
<script src="raphael.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="g.raphael.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="g.pie.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can just create a raphael canvas, and draw your chart on it.

{% highlight javascript %}
  var r = Raphael("holder");								                
  r.g.piechart(320, 240, 150, [55, 20, 13, 32, 5, 1, 2, 10]);
{% endhighlight %}


The documentation is a bit thin on the ground at the moment, but Raphaël is quite nice to work with and there are a few examples on the "website":http://g.raphaeljs.com/ to get you started.
