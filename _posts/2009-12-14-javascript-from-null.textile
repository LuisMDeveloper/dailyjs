"JavaScript from Null":http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/javascript-from-null-video-series/ is a tutorial screencast series created by Jeffrey Way.  Chapter 2 has just been published, which includes the following topics:

* Difference between = and ===, and != and !==
* How a string can have methods available to it, like toUpperCase() and length
* JavaScript native functions: parseFloat, and encodeURIComponent
* Basic Math operations

It's basic stuff but will be useful for beginners and well presented.

h3. Beans

Jonah Fox sent us a link to this blog post about "Beans":http://blog.parkerfox.co.uk/2009/12/08/beans-rubygems-for-javascript/ -- a web app that can host and concatenate JavaScript libraries.  It's similar to "Sprockets":http://getsprockets.org/ but works as a service rather than scripted tool.  This might be more suitable to your organization or way of working.

It's actually a Sinatra app, which means to install it you just need to check out the "beans GitHub repo":http://github.com/weepy/bean-server.
