Josh Timonen sent me these very professional jQuery screencasts: "Introduction to jQuery":http://screencasts.org/episodes/introduction-to-jquery and "Using AJAX with jQuery":http://screencasts.org/episodes/ajax-with-jquery.

The Introduction to jQuery video starts from the basics, even explaining the reasoning behind unobtrusive JavaScript.
