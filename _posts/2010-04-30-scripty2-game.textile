"Thomas Fuchs":http://mir.aculo.us has written up a tutorial on "building a simple game with Scripty2":http://mir.aculo.us/2010/04/30/build-a-flash-like-game-with-scripty2/.  The tutorial covers a lot, including how to structure a game in JavaScript, and how easings work.

It's a very simple game, but if you've ever wondered how to start building games in JavaScript then you should get something out of it.

h3. Heroku on Node

"Heroku announced experimental Node support":http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2010/4/28/node_js_support_experimental/.  I've applied to test it, but I haven't heard anything back yet.  Once I can get access I'll post a review and tutorials.
