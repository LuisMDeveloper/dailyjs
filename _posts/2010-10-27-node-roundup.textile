h3. node-ncurses

Ncurses is something of a nemesis of mine.  Working with Ncurses is probably the least fun I've ever had programming, and I've written a fair bit of Ada in my time.  Last week I mentioned Node FFI, which made me wonder if anyone would knock up a quick Ncurses binding, but then I found an existing one called "node-ncurses":http://github.com/mscdex/node-ncurses.

Ncurses refers to "New Curses", it's an emulation layer for curses that uses Terminfo and a bunch of other stuff so you can make text-based interfaces.  If you've ever used mutt, irssi, or lynx you'll know what I mean.

The author has documented the entire API in the readme, it looks a lot like C Ncurses from what I remember of it.  The examples demonstrate the API:

{% highlight javascript %}
var nc = require('../ncurses'), consts = require('../ncconsts');

var win = new nc.ncWindow();
win.print("Max number of colors supported by this terminal == " + win.numColors + "\n");
win.print("Max number of color pairs supported by this terminal == " + win.maxColorPairs + "\n\n");
win.print("White on black\n");
{% endhighlight %}

You might think I'm joking about Ncurses being my nemesis, but every time I run the node-ncurses examples I get "kernel panics":http://github.com/mscdex/node-ncurses/issues#issue/3!

h3. Wilson

"Wilson":http://github.com/chrisdickinson/wilson by Chris Dickinson is a Django-style Node framework.  There's an "example app":http://github.com/chrisdickinson/wilson-example/ that uses postgres and "documentation":http://readthedocs.org/projects/chrisdickinson/wilson/docs/ at readthedocs.org.  If you look at "Dickinson's other projects":http://github.com/chrisdickinson you can see he's created quite a few that draw on ideas from Django.
