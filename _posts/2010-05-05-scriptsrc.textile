If, like me, you find memorising Google's JavaScript library URLs difficult, then you may want to bookmark "scriptsrc.net":http://scriptsrc.net/.  It has a user-friendly list of all the major libraries for googleapis.com.

A related project that I've had in my DailyJS bookmark folder for a few months is "CDN Catalog":http://www.cdncatalog.com/.  This lists JavaScript and CSS libraries.

These projects are great if you're working on a static page that uses lots of JavaScript.  I've used googleapis.com for examples to share on blogs, widgets, and as a way of keeping my traffic down.

One additional bonus of using JavaScript served this way is ISPs will already have the files cached.
