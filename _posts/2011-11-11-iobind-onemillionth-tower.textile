h3. Backbone.ioBind

"Backbone.ioBind":http://alogicalparadox.com/backbone.iobind/ (GitHub: "logicalparadox / backbone.iobind":https://github.com/logicalparadox/backbone.iobind, License: _MIT_) by Jake Luer binds socket.io events to Backbone model and collection events, and also adds a drop in replacement for <code>Backbone.sync</code> that uses socket.io.  This makes building applications that sync across multiple browser instances much easier.

There's an obligatory example to-do list app, with instructions for installation here: "Backbone.ioBind Example App":https://github.com/logicalparadox/backbone.iobind/wiki/Example-App.

Using <code>ioBind</code> in models and controllers is straightforward enough:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Example Model.extend
urlRoot: 'todo',
initialize: function() {
  _.bindAll(this, 'serverChange', 'serverDelete', 'modelCleanup');
  this.ioBind('update', window.socket, this.serverChange, this);
  this.ioBind('delete', window.socket, this.serverDelete, this);
}

// Example Collection.exend
url: 'todos',
initialize: function() {
  _.bindAll(this, 'serverCreate', 'collectionCleanup');
  this.ioBind('create', window.socket, this.serverCreate, this);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Jake notes that Backbone.ioBind works well with "Backbone.ModelBinding":https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.modelbinding, which is another useful Backbone library for data binding.

h3. One Millionth Tower

!/images/posts/onemillionth.png!

"One Millionth Tower":http://highrise.nfb.ca/onemillionthtower/ is a WebGL and HTML5-powered documentary about high-rise apartments, with one particular neighbourhood explored in detail:

bq. You see them all over the world. More than a billion of us live in highrises. But most of these low- and middle-income buildings are now aging and falling into disrepair. Could life in the global highrise be different?

The technology used to drive the documentary is available on GitHub here: "m4robb / one-millionth-tower":https://github.com/m4robb/one-millionth-tower.

h3. Popcorn.js

!/images/posts/popcornjs.png!

"Popcorn.js":http://popcornjs.org/ (GitHub: "webmademovies / popcorn-js":https://github.com/webmademovies/popcorn-js, License: _MIT_) from Mozilla is a HTML5 media framework for creating timeline-based web presentations.  This means events on a video's timeline can coincide with images, text, or rich data from sources like social networks.  A list of "Popcorn.js plugins":http://popcornjs.org/plugins demonstrates some of the current possibilities.

I've reviewed similar frameworks before on DailyJS, but this must be the most advanced and polished implementation I've seen so far.
