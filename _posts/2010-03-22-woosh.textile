I was looking through "glow2's":http://github.com/glow/glow2 commits, and I noticed references to "Woosh":http://github.com/jakearchibald/Woosh/, a JavaScript speed testing framework written by "Jake Archibald":http://jakearchibald.co.uk/.  It's being used in a similar way to "slickspeed":http://mootools.net/slickspeed/ to test glow2's performance.

Tests look like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
woosh.addTests('testSomething',
  'Test 1': new woosh.Test(timesToRun, function() {
    return testFunction();
  })
});
{% endhighlight %}

"Frances Berriman":http://fberriman.com/ (one of the glow authors) wrote a very detailed Woosh tutorial: "JavaScript speed testing tutorial with Woosh":http://fberriman.com/2010/01/12/javascript-speed-testing-with-woosh/.
