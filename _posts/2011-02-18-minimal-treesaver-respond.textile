h3. minimal.js

"minimal.js":https://github.com/ruidlopes/minimal.js by Rui Lopes is a HTML/JSON template engine, for use with client-side JavaScript or Node.  In minimal.js there's no new template language to learn -- the templates are HTML and the data is JSON.  It doesn't depend on frameworks like jQuery, but can work alongside them. 

{% highlight html %}
<h1></h1>
<p></p>
<p id="footer"></p>
{% endhighlight %}

Which gets populated by using minimal.js like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
$m({
  h1: "this is a title",
  p: "this is a paragraph",
  footer: "this is a footer"
});
{% endhighlight %}

Iteration can be used, there's a good example of this using unordered lists:

{% highlight html %}
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

And:

{% highlight javascript %}
$m({
  ul: ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
});
{% endhighlight %}

Results in:

{% highlight javascript %}
<ul>
  <li>foo</li>
  <li>bar</li>
  <li>baz</li>
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

This library has a lot more features, but the simple idea of cleanly separating templates from data got me wondering about combining it with "Backbone.js":http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/.

h3. Treesaver

!/images/posts/treesaver.png!

"Treesaver":http://treesaverjs.com/ (GitHub: "Treesaver / treesaver":https://github.com/Treesaver/treesaver, MIT and GPLv2) by Filipe Fortes and Bram Stein is a framework for creating magazine-style layouts.  There's a "Treesaver tutorial":https://github.com/Treesaver/treesaver/wiki/Walkthrough which demonstrates creating the above example.

h3. Respond

"Respond":https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond (MIT or GPL Version 2) by Scott Jehl helps with creating "responsive web designs":http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/ -- essentially CSS3 media query support for Internet Explorer 8 and under.  Scott has worked at making the script fast and lightweight.

JavaScript is typically my ultimate solution for fixing IE6+ behaviour, so I don't have a problem with Respond sitting in my toolkit next to "Modernizr":http://www.modernizr.com/.
