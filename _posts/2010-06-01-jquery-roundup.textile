Welcome to the jQuery Plugin Roundup, episode 10.  Remember you can send your plugins in for review through our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

h3. jquery-offline

"jquery-offline":http://github.com/wycats/jquery-offline by Yehuda Katz helps build JavaScript applications that run on unpredictable connections, like mobile web apps.  This plugin can make use of a "HTML5 cache manifest":http://www.w3.org/TR/offline-webapps/#offline and "jquery-tmpl":http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl to make building content from JSON data relatively straightforward.

bq. Because of the architecture of jQuery Offline, you can call $.retrieveJSON whether or not the user is online, and the plugin will either make an immediate request or kick off a request when the user comes back online. This also means you can kick off a timer for a request for new content in the callback to jQuery.retrieveJSON.

h3. Lightbox_me

It seems like I've already written about a lot of lightbox plugins, but "Lightbox_me":http://buckwilson.me/lightboxme/ (Apache License, Version 2.0) is a relatively small and useful addition to the collection.  It adds events to handle window resizes, and has a very small DOM footprint, unlike many lightbox solutions which can be quite heavy.

h3. Mapbox

I've had to write a cut-down Google Maps style map interface before, and it's not trivial.  "Mapbox":http://wayfarerweb.com/jquery/plugins/mapbox/ (MIT License) would have been a good alternative: it can show multiple layers of content, supports mousewheel zoom, and has a simple API and DOM requirements.

Although Google Maps is great, there are times when a real map isn't required or a particular project's licensing or legal requirements prohibit Google Maps.  It's worth keeping projects like this in your bookmarks for just such occasions.
