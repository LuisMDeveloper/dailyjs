"Cappuccino":http://cappuccino.org has been updated to 0.8.  This version includes a table view implementation (which iPhone and Cocoa developers will be all too familiar with), and other bug fixes and minor updates.

The most exciting thing about this release is that the entire stack is now JavaScript.  That means the Cappuccino code has no external dependencies -- it no-longer requires tools like Rake, opting instead for JavaScript and Objective-J.

The Cappuccino blog has more details: "Cappuccino 0.8":http://cappuccino.org/discuss/2010/04/07/cappuccino-0-8/
