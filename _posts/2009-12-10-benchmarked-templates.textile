Brian Landau sent us these "JavaScript template library benchmarks":http://www.viget.com/extend/benchmarking-javascript-templating-libraries/, which tests the following libraries:

* jQuery Templates
* mustache.js
* underscore
* jQuote
* Srender
* Tempest
* nano
* wayneeseguinâ€™s jquery_templates

The benchmarks are based on "PPK's benchmarking methodology":http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/08/when_to_read_ou.html.  The results suggest that the libraries all have similar performance characteristics.  Brian concludes that mustache.js is the best library if your templates contain heavy iteration over data, otherwise nano is a good choice.

To download all of the libraries and tests in one convenient package, check out "brianjlandau/js-templates-benchmark":http://github.com/brianjlandau/js-templates-benchmark from GitHub.
