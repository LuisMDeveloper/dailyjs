Version 2.0 of the "JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit":http://thejit.org/ ("License":http://github.com/philogb/jit/blob/master/LICENSE) has been released.  InfoVis, by Nicolas Garcia Belmonte, ships with a wide range of interesting data visualisation types, and can be used to create customised visualisations or generic graphs.  For examples, see the extensive "demos":http://thejit.org/demos/ page.

Everything sits under <code>$jit</code>, so the library should be easy to slot into existing projects.  To read more about the API, browse the "API documentation":http://thejit.org/static/v20/Docs/files/Core/Core-js.html.

Version 2.0 adds:

* New visualisations (AreaChart, BarChart, PieChart, Sunburst, Force-Directed)
* Mobile support
* An events system
* Panning and zooming
* Animation improvements
* Cleaner API (the major change is the use of the global object, <code>$jit</code>)
