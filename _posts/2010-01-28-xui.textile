I was recently reviewing mobile web JavaScript frameworks when I came across "XUI":http://xuijs.com/, by "Brian LeRoux":http://brianleroux.github.com/ and the other "PhoneGap":http://phonegap.com/ authors.  XUI is a micro-framework -- it's designed to be small, portable and concise.

XUI provides the following features:

* Element lookup through selectors
* Events, with support for touch screens
* DOM manipulation
* Animation through tweening
* XmlHttpRequest

The API is available through the global <code>x$</code>.  Usage looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
x$('li','.selected', '#some_id'); // Returns elements for a selector or list, similar to $ in jQuery and $$ in Prototype
x$('#video').html('inner', '<strong>Rick Roll</strong>'); // Modifies the HTML of an element
x$('a.save').on('click', function(e) { alert('Saving...') }); // Events
x$('#box').tween([{ left:100px, backgroundColor:'green', duration:.2 }, { right:100px }]); // Tweening
{% endhighlight %}

You might be wondering why XUI is smaller and faster than frameworks like jQuery.  Ultimately it's because they've cut the cross-browser chaff that we need for cross-browser development.  They've also tightly focused on mobile web development.

It's smart of the PhoneGap developers to extract this framework, much like "Sizzle":http://sizzlejs.com/ was a good idea.  In fact, there are enough useful features in it to do a lot without even using the rest of PhoneGap!
