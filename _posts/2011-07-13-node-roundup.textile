h3. New Node Branding

!/images/posts/new-node-design.png!

In "Evolving the Node.js Brand":http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/07/11/evolving-the-node-js-brand/, Emily Tanaka-Delgado of Joyent discusses the reasoning behind the new Node website and logo.  The new logo initially attracted a mixed response, but I'm sure it'll grow on us over time.  Emily writes:

bq. To echo Nodeâ€™s evolutionary nature, we have refreshed the identity to help mark an exciting time for developers.

So perhaps it's fair to say this iteration of Node's logo is the difficult second album?

h3. Node Bindings for Hadoop Hive

"node-hive":https://github.com/forward/node-hive (npm: _node-hive_) by Jae is a set of bindings for "Hadoop Hive":http://hive.apache.org/, a data warehouse system for Hadoop:

{% highlight javascript %}
var hive = require('node-hive').for({ server:"hive.myserver" });

hive.fetch("SELECT * FROM my_table", function(err, data) {
  data.each(function(record) {
    console.log(record);
  });
});
{% endhighlight %}

Each query runs in its own connection.  There's currently no connection pooling, but the author notes that most users run a small number of long running hive queries so it should work well enough for most people for now.

h3. node-googl

"node-googl":https://github.com/kaimallea/node-googl (npm: _goo.gl_) is a small client for shortening URLs using Google's service:

{% highlight sh %}
goo.gl www.google.com
goo.gl http://goo.gl/fbsS
goo.gl www.google.com http://goo.gl/fbsS nba.com
{% endhighlight %}

It can be used as a module as well:

{% highlight javascript %}
var googl = require('goo.gl');

// Shorten a long url and output the result
googl.shorten('http://www.google.com/', function (shortUrl) {
    console.log(shortUrl);
});
{% endhighlight %}
