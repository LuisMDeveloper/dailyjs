"Grafico":http://kilianvalkhof.com/2010/design/grafico-javascript-charting-library/ is a charting library that provides line, area, stacked and bar graphs, as well as various types of sparklines.

Grafico also includes features like pop-up hovers.  All of the features are covered in the "documentation":http://grafico.kilianvalkhof.com/documentation/index.html.

The API looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var graph = new Grafico.GraphType($(element), data, options);
{% endhighlight %}

So drawing a line graph is easy:

{% highlight javascript %}
var linegraph = new Grafico.LineGraph($('linegraph'), { workload: [8, 10, 6, 12, 7, 6, 9] });
{% endhighlight %}
