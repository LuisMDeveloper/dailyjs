Here's some Easter weekend fun stuff -- HTML5 games!

I saw Thomas Fuchs tweet about this "HTML5 port of Quake 2":http://code.google.com/p/quake2-gwt-port/, which let's face it, is completely ridiculous.  It's not as exciting as it sounds though, because they had to create a new WebGL renderer, so it'll only work on "Safari (nightly) and Chromium":http://code.google.com/p/quake2-gwt-port/wiki/CompatibleBrowsers.  This really is cutting edge, so don't expect to be able to download a few files and get it running straight away -- it takes quiet a while to build everything.

I got it working by following the "build instructions":http://code.google.com/p/quake2-gwt-port/wiki/BuildingAndRunning then downloading Chromium and running it from the command line:

{% highlight sh %}
./Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --enable-webgl --no-sandbox
{% endhighlight %}

Another HTML5 game I've been looking at recently is "WPilot":http://jfd.github.com/wpilot/.  The code is on GitHub and more digestible than the Quake 2 source, so if you're interested in working in this area WPilot might be a good project for bootstrapping your ideas.

h3. Processing Tower Defense

"Processing Tower Defense":http://github.com/rictic/processing-tower-defense is another good example of a browser-based game codebase.  It uses "Processing.js":http://processingjs.org/, so the drawing code is easy to follow.
