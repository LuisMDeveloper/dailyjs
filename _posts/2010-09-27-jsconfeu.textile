"JSConf.eu - 2010":http://jsconf.eu/2010/ was this weekend, so a lot of interesting things have been going on in the JavaScript community.  I wasn't actually at the conference, but Oleg (who "interviewed Ryan Dahl":http://dailyjs.com/2010/08/10/ryan-dahl-interview/) stopped by, which means we should have more awesome interviews soon.

Videos of the talks haven't been posted yet, so keep your eyes on "@jsconfeu":http://twitter.com/jsconfeu.

h3. JS1k Winners

!/images/posts/js1kwinner.png!

The "JS1k":http://js1k.com/ winners were announced at the conference, with "Legend Of The Bouncing Beholder":http://js1k.com/demo/635 by "Marijn Haverbeke":http://twitter.com/marijnjh taking the top prize.  This is also one of the demos that most impressed me, in particular the whimsical graphics.

I feel like this contest was a huge success, and has been both well-received and respected by the community.  I look forward to the next one!

h3. Announcements

Joyent quietly announced a limited public beta of their "Node.js service":https://no.de/.  The people who have been playing with it seem impressed so far.

"Promotejs.com":http://promotejs.com/ was widely shared during the conference.  It's an attempt to get better search engine results for serious JavaScript documentation (instead of dodgy dotcom-era sites).

h3. Sound bites

bq. 'Does it run JavaScript' is the new 'Does it run Linux' "@phiggins":http://twitter.com/jsconfeu/status/25482880587

bq. Don't know about you, but to me, giving a talk with Brendan Eich and Douglas Crockford in the audience is pretty intimidating. :-) "@robertnyman":http://twitter.com/robertnyman/status/25486203570

bq. I don't know an unemployed JavaScript developer. "@rmurphey":http://twitter.com/joemccann/status/25504911306

bq. surrounded by sleepless drunk people listening to crockford - it must be jsconf "@aq":http://twitter.com/aq/status/25572241515
