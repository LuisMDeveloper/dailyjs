Welcome to the jQuery roundup. You can send your plugins and articles in for review through our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

h3. jQuery Fullscreen

"jquery.fullscreen.js":https://github.com/ruidlopes/jquery-fullscreen by Rui Lopes provides event detection when people switch their browser to fullscreen mode:

{% highlight javascript %}
$(window).bind('fullscreen-on', function(e) {
  // Do things that depend on fullscreen
});
{% endhighlight %}

This might be useful for building interfaces that adapt to the extra space in fullscreen mode.

The author says it's only been tested in Chrome and Firefox, and there's no cross-browser way to trigger fullscreen, but it's a fairly new plugin so it'll get updates for more major browsers soon.

h3. jQuery-Plugin-Skeleton

"jQuery-Plugin-Skeleton":https://github.com/OscarGodson/jQuery-Plugin-Skeleton by Oscar Godson is a plugin skeleton.  His skeleton includes a license in the plugin's source, but there aren't any unit test stubs.  I talked to him through GitHub's messaging system and he seemed to think sample tests might be useful.

My ideal skeleton would look like this:

* README.txt - This should contain fields for things like author name, contact, web site, links to more documentation, license name, contribution submission guidelines
* MIT_LICENSE
* GPL_LICENSE
* unit_test.js - Simple QUnit test stub
* jquery.plugin.js - Similar to Oscar's example

I imagine readers of this blog wouldn't usually use a skeleton because they probably know exactly how they want to package their plugins, but it would be nice to get new plugin authors off to a good start.

h3. Wijmo

!/images/posts/wijmo_logo.png!

"Wijmo":http://wijmo.com/ from ComponentOne LLC is an open source (dual MIT, GPL) _and_ commercial kit of jQuery UI widgets.  There are a lot of widgets available, including a very modern-looking chart library and "cool calendar":http://wijmo.com/widgets/wijmo-open/calendar/.

The "commercial license":http://wijmo.com/purchase/ is per-developer, at $499, and it's royalty free.  Although I appreciate the massive amount of open source jQuery plugins out there, I think it's interesting that a developer has built a business model around their plugins (a bit like "Sencha":http://www.sencha.com/).

Wijmo is on GitHub at "github.com/wijmo":https://github.com/wijmo/.
