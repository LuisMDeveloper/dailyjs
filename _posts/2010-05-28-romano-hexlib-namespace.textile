h3. Romano

!/images/posts/romano.png!

"Romano":http://github.com/patternleaf/Romano is a HTML5 game library for creating 2D games.  It includes features to help with sprite handling, basic physics, and collision detection.

The project depends on jQuery and Raphael, and the APIs work through jQuery-inspired object-oriented code.

h3. Hexlib

"Hexlib":http://github.com/jimbojw/hexlib (MIT License) is a library for making tile games played on a hexagonal grid.  There's a demo on "hexlib.com":http://hexlib.com that you can play around with.

The code has some inline documentation, and you can look at the hexlib.com source ("script.js":http://hexlib.com/hexlib/js/script.js) for an example of the library in use.

h3. Namespace.js

"Namespace.js":http://code.google.com/p/namespacedotjs/ is a little library for creating namespaces in JavaScript and loading remote files.  Usage looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
Namespace('com.example', {
   MyClass: function() { return {}; }
});
var obj = new com.example.MyClass();

Namespace.use('com.example.MyClass');
var obj2 = new MyClass();
{% endhighlight %}
