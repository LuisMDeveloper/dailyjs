h3. Kod

!/images/posts/kod-editor.png!

"Kod":http://kodapp.com/ by Rasmus Andersson is an editor for Mac OS that uses Node as the scripting language.  The interface looks and behaves a lot like Google's Chrome, and the editor and syntax highlighting are styled with CSS.  It's designed to be concurrent so the app should feel fast, and it's built using Objective-C.

If you're a Mac-based JavaScript developer, Kod might suit you.  If you want to try it, register for a beta invite and take a look at this discussion: "Kod Beta thread":http://groups.google.com/group/kod-app/browse_thread/thread/7c1c006b84b669a0/34ab8a4c79e49829#34ab8a4c79e49829.

h3. Node, USB, and Kinect

Schakko, who writes "node-usb":https://github.com/schakko/node-usb, has added "node-usb-kinect.js":https://github.com/schakko/node-usb/blob/master/examples/node-usb-kinect.js which talks to Microsoft's Kinect.  So if you get one for Christmas and quickly tire of the boring arm-waving games, maybe you could hack it with Node!
