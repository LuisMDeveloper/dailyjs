"Every Time Zone":http://everytimezone.com/ by "Amy Hoy":http://slash7.com/company/ is a guide to time zones that uses innovative HTML5 features.  It looks best in Safari, but it still just about works in Firefox.

It's an interesting piece of work from visualization perspective, but it also has concise JavaScript without any dependencies.  This includes browser feature detection:

{% highlight javascript %}
(function(){
  var supportsTouch = ('createTouch' in document),
    scale = 72, now = new Date, current = now, day = current.getDate(), 
{% endhighlight %}

I know how difficult working with time zones can be, so I'll probably actually have to use this in the near future.  It's also interesting to see such a simple tool that specifically targets modern browser features without compromising its quality by supporting legacy browsers.
