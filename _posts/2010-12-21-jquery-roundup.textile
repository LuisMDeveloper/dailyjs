Welcome to the jQuery roundup 37. You can send your plugins and articles in for review through our "contact form":/contact.html or "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs.

h3. FullCalendar

!/images/posts/fullcalendar.png!

"FullCalendar":http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/ (GitHub: "arshaw / fullcalendar":https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar, GPL/MIT Dual License) by Adam Shaw is an incredibly elaborate jQuery calendar plugin.

It reminds me of Google's calendar, but he's also got a "jQuery UI themed demo":http://arshaw.com/js/fullcalendar/demos/theme.html which shows a calendar with a theme.  It doesn't support editing, but it would be possible to add support using the events, which are listed in "FullCalendar's documentation":http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/.

Even better, the project comes with "tests":https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar/tree/master/tests and a "Makefile":https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar/blob/master/Makefile!  It's not often I come across jQuery plugins that are packaged this well, believe me.

h3. Capty

"Capty":http://www.wbotelhos.com/capty/ (GitHub: "wbotelhos / capty":https://github.com/wbotelhos/capty, MIT License) by Washington Botelho is a little plugin that displays a caption over an image based on the <code>alt</code> attribute:

{% highlight html %}
$('#capty').capty();

<img id="capty" src="image.jpg" alt="Example" />
{% endhighlight %}

If the image has a <code>name</code> attribute with a selector, it'll use the selector for the caption's content (see the _A custom caption with a external content_ example).

The author has more interesting plugins on his GitHub account, "wbotelhos":https://github.com/wbotelhos.  In particular the "Wizard plugin":https://github.com/wbotelhos/stepy caught my eye, which I thought was something to do with incredible magical powers, but it's actually just for making multi-stage form wizards.

h3. Absolution Updates

!/images/posts/absolution.png!

MichaÃ«l Vanderheeren has been working on his "Absolution":https://github.com/michaelvanderheeren/Absolution jQuery UI theme.  This theme uses CSS3, and has some interesting demos:

* "Registration form demo":http://absolution.michaelvanderheeren.be/demos/registration.html
* "Equalizer demo":http://absolution.michaelvanderheeren.be/demos/equalizer.html
* "File, progress bars, and tabs":http://absolution.michaelvanderheeren.be/demos/download.html

He's been making a lot of small tweaks lately so it uses more CSS3 and looks cleaner than before.

This is one of the themes I previously covered in a general "jQuery UI roundup":http://dailyjs.com/2010/09/21/jquery-roundup/.
