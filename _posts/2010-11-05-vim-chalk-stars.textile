h3. JavaScript Starfield

!/images/posts/starfield.png!

When I was a teenager I spent hours writing starfields on my Amiga.  It's quite a rewarding effect given the amount of effort required.  If you want to do the same thing with Canvas, Charles Leifer has written a tutorial in "More fun with Canvas - a JavaScript Starfield!":http://charlesleifer.com/blog/more-fun-with-canvas-a-javascript-starfield/

h3. jslint.vim

"jslint.vim":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2729 is a handy Vim plugin for running JSLint.  It automatically highlights errors, and can display extra information in the command line when the cursor is over the error.

h3. 37signals' Chalk Dissected

In "37signals' Chalk Dissected":http://samisamhuri.blogspot.com/2010/11/37signals-chalk-dissected.html by Sami Samhuri, the author looks at the techniques used to create 37signals' "Chalk":http://chalk.37signals.com, a simple drawing web app designed for iPad.

bq. I dove into the JavaScript a little and explained most of it. Sam Stephenson tweeted that Chalk is written in CoffeeScript and compiled on the fly when served using Brochure

Interesting that he uses CoffeeScript, given that he's the Prototype Guy&trade;.
