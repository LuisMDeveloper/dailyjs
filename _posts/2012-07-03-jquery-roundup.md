###jQuery 2.0: Dropping Support for IE6-8

Last week, Dave Methvin posted about [jQuery 1.9 and beyond](http://blog.jquery.com/2012/06/28/jquery-core-version-1-9-and-beyond/).  jQuery 2.0, which should be released in early 2013, will remove support for IE6-8.  If you've followed the [Let's Make a Framework](http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmaf) posts, you'll have learned about a lot of the special cases frameworks have to include to support older versions of Internet Explorer.  In an effort to clean up jQuery and stablise the API -- in fact, 2.0 should be compatible with 1.9:

> Our goal is for 1.9 and 2.0 to be interchangeable as far as the API set they support. When 2.0 comes out, your decision on which version to choose should be as simple as this: If you need IE 6/7/8 support, choose 1.9; otherwise you can use either 1.9 or 2.0.

Due to the backlash (for and against) the IE support changes, Dave wrote a follow-up post: [jQuery 1.9 and 2.0 - TL;DR Edition](http://blog.jquery.com/2012/07/01/jquery-1-9-and-2-0-tldr-edition/).  This attempts to answer common questions asked by the community:

> Why is the jQuery core team dropping support for oldIE (IE 6/7/8)? We're not! jQuery 1.9 will support oldIE when it's released next year. The jQuery team will continue to support and maintain version 1.9 even after jQuery 2.0 is released.

###jQuery UI 1.9 Beta

[jQuery UI 1.9 Beta](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/06/jquery-ui-1-9-beta/) has been announced, which includes:

* Autocomplete accessibility updates
* Accordion API redesign and accessibility updates
* Tabs API redesign
* Position API redesign

There are also new widgets, including the [Spinner widget](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138077/Spinner).

###Handpicked jQuery Plugins v2
