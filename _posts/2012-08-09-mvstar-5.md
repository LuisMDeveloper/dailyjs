Last week we looked at [Backbone's History and View APIs](http://dailyjs.com/2012/08/02/mvstar-4/).  We're coming to the end of this detailed look at Backbone's internals, but there are still a few interesting things left:

* Backbone's inheritance implementation
* `Backbone.sync`

###Backbone's inheritance Implementation

The comments indicate that the `inherits` function is inspired by `goog.inherits`.  Google's implementation is from the [Closure Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/introduction), but Backbone's API accepts two objects (incorrectly referred to as a hash) containing "instance" and "static" methods.  Each of Backbone's objects has an `extend` method:

{% highlight javascript %}
Model.extend = Collection.extend = Router.extend = View.extend = extend;
{% endhighlight %}

Most development with Backbone is based around inheriting from these objects, and they're designed to mimic a classical object-oriented implementation.

Backbone uses [Underscore's extend method](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/53c67e7be33ed17a6b4a1cabbf318ae218c65284/underscore.js#L691-698):

{% highlight javascript %}
each(slice.call(arguments, 1), function(source) {
  for (var prop in source) {
    obj[prop] = source[prop];
  }
});
return obj;
{% endhighlight %}

This isn't the same as [ES5's Object.create](http://es5.github.com/#x15.2.3.5), it's actually copying properties (methods and values) from one object to another.  Since this isn't enough to support Backbone's inheritance and class model, the following steps are performed:

1. The instance methods are checked to see if there's a `constructor` property.  If so, the class's constructor is used, otherwise the parent's constructor is used (i.e., `Backbone.Model`)
2. Underscore's `extend` method is called to add the parent class's methods to the new child class
3. The `prototype` property of a blank constructor function is assigned with the parent's prototype, and a new instance of this is set to the child's `prototype` property
4. Underscore's `extend` method is called twice to add the static and instance methods to the child class
5. The child's prototype's constructor and a `__super__` property are assigned

This pattern is also used for classes in CoffeeScript, so Backbone classes are compatible with CoffeeScript classes.

_Update_: Jeremy Ashkenas [clarified this process](https://twitter.com/jashkenas/status/234017859964108801) on Twitter:

> ... it's just your basic prototype chain, plus one extra goodie: any constructor properties (static) are copied over as well.

###Backbone's Sync API

The [Backbone.sync](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/ddefd21167c27d98fd1eb05a44e330a2313055f6/backbone.js#L1331) method is intended to be overridden to support other backends.  The built-in method is tailed to a certain breed of RESTful JSON APIs -- Backbone was originally extracted from a Ruby on Rails application, which uses HTTP methods like `PUT` the same way.

The way this works is the model and collection classes have a `sync` method that calls `Backbone.sync`.  Both will call `this.sync` internally when fetching, saving, or deleting items.

The `sync` method is called with three parameters:

* `method`: One of `create`, `update`, `delete`, `read`
* `model`: The Backbone model object
* `options`: May include success and error methods

Implementing a new `sync` method can use the following pattern:

{% highlight javascript %}
Backbone.sync = function(method, model, options) {
  var requestContent = {}, success, error;

  function success(result) {
    // Handle results from MyAPI
    if (options.success) {
      options.success(result);
    }
  }

  function error(result) {
    // Handle results from MyAPI
    if (options.error) {
      options.error(result);
    }
  }

  options || (options = {});

  switch (method) {
    case 'create':
      requestContent['resource'] = model.toJSON();
      return MyAPI.create(model, success, error);

    case 'update':
      requestContent['resource'] = model.toJSON();
      return MyAPI.update(model, success, error);

    case 'delete':
      return MyAPI.destroy(model, success, error);

    case 'read':
      if (model.attributes[model.idAttribute]) {
        return MyAPI.find(model, success, error);
      } else {
        return MyAPI.findAll(model, success, error);
      }
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

This pattern delegates API calls to a new object, which could be a Backbone-style class that supports events.  This can be safely tested separately, and potentially used with libraries other than Backbone.

There are quite a few sync implementations out there:

* [Backbone Redis](https://github.com/sorensen/backbone-redis)
* [backbone-parse](https://github.com/neebz/backbone-parse)
* [Backbone localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage)
* [backbone-websql](https://github.com/MarrLiss/backbone-websql)
* [Backbone Caching Sync](https://github.com/ggozad/Backbone.cachingSync)
