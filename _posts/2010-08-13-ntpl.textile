h3. nTPL

"nTPL":http://github.com/donnerjack13589/nTPL by "Fedor Indutny":http://habrastat.ru/ is a simple templating system for Node.  The author has concentrated on making it fast, and it can be installed with <code>npm</code>.

Part of this library is written with C++, and it can reload templates when the file is saved.  It's not a template language like haml, so if you're looking for a Node-friendly alternative to haml you could try "Jade":http://jade-lang.com/.

h3. Tab Completion in Node

I checked out the latest version of Node yesterday, and I noticed tab completion was mentioned.  It looks like the readline support has been improved by Trent Mick, and this was posted to the group:  "Node v0.1.104":http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/867a3ca129586dfc.

I actually alias <code>rlwrap js</code> for various JavaScript REPLs because I'm used to history and completion.  If you've never tried it before it's worth knowing about.  I installed it with either dpkg, port, or Homebrew, but you can get the source here: "rlwrap":http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/rlwrap/.
