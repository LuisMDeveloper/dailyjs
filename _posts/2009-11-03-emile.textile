"Emile":http://github.com/madrobby/emile is an animation framework written by "Thomas Fuchs":http://mir.aculo.us/.  It's based around CSS animation, with an API that uses callbacks and tween (easing) functions.

It's currently very small, but does what most people need from JavaScript animations.  It might be interesting to try pairing it up with "Sizzle":http://sizzlejs.com/ for projects that need a small footprint.
