You've probably seen a lot of hype around HTML5 video recently.  I've been researching open source libraries to see what's currently available. However, today I found "SublimeVideo":http://jilion.com/sublime/video which is a player that supports seeking, full-window view, draggable controls and keyboard shortcuts.

This really works best in WebKit nightlies.  The main reason for this is the fullscreen support and the speed of the effects.

The associated JavaScript is currently copyrighted with a disclaimer that says it can't be used beyond the demo.  The demo is worth checking out though, if only as an example of a strong lightweight JavaScript and HTML-based video player.
