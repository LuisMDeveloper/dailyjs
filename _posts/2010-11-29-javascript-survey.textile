Last year I ran the "DailyJS JavaScript Developer Survey":http://dailyjs.com/2009/11/25/javascript-survey/ ("results":http://dailyjs.com/2009/12/02/survey-results/).  It produced some interesting results that are useful to both open source and commercial developers, so I'd like to run it again.

The results of this survey will be shared with the community on DailyJS, and are also visible after submitting the survey.

No personal details will be collected in this survey.

The survey is now closed.
